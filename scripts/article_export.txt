	Scuba Diving in Iceland

	When you think of Iceland you probably image great landscapes and the Northern Lights, but what you might not know is that this is a really fantastic country to go scuba diving.

	 

	Top Reasons to Go Diving in Iceland

	By booking a dive in Iceland you will get to experience something you will always remember, in one of the most different dive locations in the world. There is also amazing water visibility, great photography opportunities and bizarre creatures to be seen. Most dive instructor are also from Iceland and so you will also get to learn more about the country, culture and dive sites.

	 

	Best Scuba Diving and Snorkelling Sites in Iceland

	The most popular dive site in Iceland is probably Silfra, a glacial-water-filled ravine that is located between the tectonic plates of Europe and North America. This is a world famous dive site which is unique, not many places in the world can you go diving inbetween two tectonic-plates. This is one of the best cold water dive locations on the planet and somewhere you might want to visit if you are a total beginner or advanced level. You will get full preparation and a dry suit which will be needed due to the temperature of the water. On the journey to Silfra, you will get to visit the spectacular Thingvellir National Park, this country really is one of the most scenic places to go scuba diving in Europe. 

	 

	Can Anyone Scuba Dive Between the Tectonic Plates of Silfra?

	Silfra can be a challenging dive site even if you have previous experience of diving, this is due to the extremely cold waters which most divers are not used to. It can take some time and adjustment to get used to wearing a dry suit which might suprise you how heavy they are especially when the other equipement is added.

	 

	Best Time to Go Scuba Diving in Iceland

	Iceland has very unpredictable weather and we recommend going diving during summer when the weather and climate is warmer. Another great time to dive is from September to April when you will get to combine diving with seeing the Northern Lights.

	 

	How to Book a Course

	You can book dive courses in advance online or once in Iceland in places like Reykjavik. Iceland really is one of the most up and coming scuba diving destinations abroad for people seeking an authentic experience away from the hustle and bustle of places like Thailand. We recommend getting here before the crowds arrive.

	 

	Iceland Dive Reviews

	If you would like to review a dive centre, excursion or experience please get in touch we would love to hear from you.

	5 Reasons to Join an Adventure Bus Tour

	 

	If it&#39;s your first adventure or you&#39;re a seasoned traveller, an adventure bus is always a good idea.

	 

	Many of these buses tend to offer a hop-on, hop-off service: use it! You can explore more places, meet more people, and take more time. But which one to choose!? There are a lot of options out there. Take a look at what&#39;s on offer before you buy, and see what suits you best - where they stop, what routes they take etc. For example, the Stray Travel tagline is &#39;off the beaten track&#39;, Kiwi Experience advertises itself as how &#39;youthful travellers see New Zealand&#39;, and G Adventures specializes in small-group custom made travel. There&#39;s definitely something for everyone.

	But what are the reasons for hopping on in the first place?

	 

	 

	1. The Driver

	 

	You might think they&#39;re just the floating head or the bodiless voice at the front of the bus, but you&#39;d be wrong.. they are so much more.

	 

	They&#39;ll play a part in your travelling family as much as anyone else you meet - in my experience they&#39;ll join in with your activities, they&#39;ll take you to great views, show you some of their favourite spots, tell you local stories, provide all the information you need, become great drinking buddies and (perhaps most importantly) book your accommodation.

	 

	I&#39;ve seen drivers that do spontaneous bungee jumps, snow tube like a boss, down shots on a pub crawl and have balloon making competitions on the bus. I&#39;ve been taken on walks that I wouldn&#39;t have known about and been rewarded with the most incredible views and photo opportunities.

	They&#39;ve got your back, and they want you to have a great time.

	 

	2. People

	 

	Yes, if you don&#39;t travel on an adventure bus tour you will still meet a variety of people from all over the world. But there&#39;s something about being thrown together and spending hours travelling, nights in new places and sharing new experiences with a group of people that is incredible. If you spend anything over 3 days on the same bus at a time you&#39;ll grow together, you&#39;ll become some sort of wonderful dysfunctional family.

	 

	There was a gang of us that were from the UK, the Netherlands, Malaysia, France, Germany, Spain, Canada and America - and it was the best fun I&#39;d had.

	 

	I learnt so much from them - from the ways of a Dutch sense of humour, to the ins and outs of Spanish politics. Unsurprisingly lack of wifi is one of the best things that can happen to you: playing card games followed by multi-lingual scrabble and a big group meal, is a sure fire way of making incredible friends and great memories.

	 

	 

	3. Safety

	Safety in numbers also applies whilst travelling. Adventure buses provide you with a feeling of safety and security when you most need it, not only are you travelling in a group so that potential feeling of loneliness doesn&#39;t creep in but, the bigger companies especially, can also give you guaranteed nightly accommodation and book you a number of activities on a daily basis. It can put your mind at rest and makes travelling that little bit less chaotic and stressful, and a whole lot more enjoyable.

	 

	It caters to those that want an element of organisation along with some spontaneity, and also those that want all of the spontaneity without having to think of how to get there each time.

	 

	With your ability to hop-on and hop-off, if you want to escape a place you feel like you&#39;ve spent one too many nights in you can just hop on again and be transported to the next stunning destination. It really can be a lifeline.

	 

	4. Activities

	 

	Adventure buses are definitely one of the best ways to get the most out of the most adrenalin packed countries in the world. There&#39;s skydives, bungee jumps, kayaking, glacier hikes, helicopter flights.. and your driver can book them all. There&#39;s so many things to do - each location comes with a different selection of activities, if you don&#39;t fancy any of them you really don&#39;t have to spend your money on them, but if you do want to do something just go for it! You&#39;re bound to regret it if you don&#39;t, and what&#39;s the point in being in New Zealand if you don&#39;t grab every opportunity with both hands?

	Some things can be discounted as part of your tour deal and you get to do it with your travelling family.

	Seemingly simple things like doing doughnuts in a water taxi followed by a four hour walk in apocalyptic, torrential rain can make for ridiculous but great memories. It might&#39;ve been awful at the time, but I&#39;m glad I did it now! And let&#39;s be honest, it wouldn&#39;t have happened without my adventure bus.

	 

	5. The Journey

	 

	It might sound obvious, but the locations you travel to and the journeys you take to get there make everything worthwhile. Depending on which company you travel with you can visit places you hadn&#39;t considered before leaving home and see things you hadn&#39;t imagined.

	Sure, however you travel you&#39;ll see amazing things - but by doing an adventure tour you&#39;ll get to enjoy the travelling from place to place on a bus full of friends, laughing, music, and chatter.

	 

	There are a number of bus services available in New Zealand that can get you from place to place, and that offer nationwide passes, including; Intercity, Naked Buses, Nelson Coaches etc. These can still be used as great options for one-off spontaneous trips, especially to places your bus might not visit. But you won&#39;t get that camaraderie, that sense of adventure and that element of fun if you use it for your whole experience.

	 

	Whichever you choose, you&#39;ll get stories to tell and experiences you&#39;ll laugh about later.

	 

	I promise.

10 Amazing Experiences of My Working Holiday in the USA

	Nitika Erueti-Satish from the UK has always been an adventure chasing kind of girl and is currently working in America on a J1 visa. She has been in the United States for 9 months now living in the Bay Area (San Fran to the East Bay – Oakland) and has enjoyed every minute of it, Here she shares the highlights of her trip and the top 10 things she has done so far.


	
		
			
				Top 10 Moments of Working in the USA
			
				10 Highlights of My J1 Working Holiday in the USA
			
				My Top 10 Highlights of Working in the United States
			
				10 Highlights of a Year Working in the United States
			
				Want to Work in the USA? 10 Amazing Experiences of My Working Holiday
			
				 10 Amazing Experiences of My Working Holiday in the USA
			
				My Unforgettable Year Working in the USA
			
				 
			
				 
			
				The whole experience of living and working in the USA still doesn&#39;t seem real to me, I have had so many surreal and exciting experiences. From the food to the concerts, to finding a job or two, enjoying time with my family, making new friends and not to mention taking in all of the sites I have been able to visit.
			
				Scroll down to check out my top 10 moments that I still can’t believe have happened to me this past year starting with…
			
				 
			
				10. Portland, OR
			
				
			
				My first impression of Portland had me feeling more connected to nature than I have ever been since moving to the US. This city is situated amongst beautiful snowy mountains and has the amazingly gorgeous Colombia River, the largest river in the Pacific Northwest region of America, acting as a boarder separating Oregon and Washington State. The people are extra friendly and are always down to help you find your way or give you some advice about things to do. It’s also a foody city so if you love to eat make sure to delegate funds dedicated to satisfying your hunger pains.
			
				My favorite sweet treats to try was the Voodoo Doughnuts and ice-cream from Salt n Straw. When I was feeling a little low and needed a boost I always found myself hitting the food trucks located in downtown Portland between Southwest Alder and Washington Street (best times to go is around lunch). For epic scenic views I’d recommend checking out the Japanese Gardens or booking a seat on the Afternoon Half-Day Multnomah Falls and Columbia River Gorge Waterfalls Tour provided by Hub World Travel.
			
				 
			
				9. Universal Studios
			
				
			
				If you’re a film/cinema junky you will fall head over heels in love with Universal Studios. This is my most favorite part of LA. I was also lucky enough to experience the studios with my cousins from Aotearoa, New Zealand and we had a blast. The Harry Potter attraction was my most favorite of all. It was very well built and every single detail seen in the movies was perfectly carved and sculpted to give you that real life feeling of being a young wizard running amuck in Hogwarts.
			
				My second favorite was the Jurassic Park attraction. The ride scared the shit out me not to mention left us soaking wet! Definitely invest in a waterproof poncho or trash bag before jumping on these rides! I’m sure they sell these at Universal Studios but it will be cheaper buying them at the Dollar Store.
			
				The only downside to attending such a heavenly place is waiting in line. Sometimes it can be a 30 – 45 minute wait to get to the front of the line. If you have cash to burn I’d recommend splashing out on a Universal Express pass that gets you a 1 day general admission with a one-time express access to each ride, attraction and seated show. I would also like to quickly mention that there is a real life Moe’s bar that sells Duff Beer and it is divine!
			
				 
			
				8. LA Angels Base Ball Game
			
				
			
				I’ve never been a fan of Base Ball but there is something about a live game that really gets me going. Luckily for me I have loving cousins who spoil me and hooked it up with tickets. The Angels Stadium in Anaheim is so big! There are concession stands all around stocked with loads of sugary treats, sodas, pretzels, hot dogs and more but the thing that stood out for me was the walking concession stands crawling through the seated crowds yelling out at the top of their lungs “CHURRRRRRO’S” or “COTTON CAAAANDY”. My overall experience of the game was pretty great, I had a great time and more importantly the Angels won!
			
				 
			
				7. BART (Bay Area Rides Together)
			
				Here in the Bay Area one of the main sources of public transportation is riding the Bart (train). It may seem a little crazy having Bart in my top 10 list but as the saying goes “don’t knock it till you try it” because being a passenger on these trains is actually pretty entertaining. You are guaranteed to see dancers, singers, poets and other forms of entertainment busking on the trains. They normally perform, between stops and ask for a small donation after their performances. This by far is such a cool thing to witness! Of course you will also see the usual drunks, preachers, verbal exchanges, beggars and homeless on the Bart that adds to its unusually hip feng shui. On that note the Bart is safe. There are always Bart Police around and the controllers are pretty cool too!
			
				 
			
				6. The Holiday’s
			
				
			
				The holiday period kicks off around Thanks Giving which always falls on the 4th Thursday in November each year. Traditionally this holiday symbolized the blessing of the harvest. It was pretty much a party the pilgrims put on to come together with the Native Americans over the sharing of a feast before the pillaging took place. But that was back in the old days. Now days it’s all about that family time and bonding. A good tip I’d like to mention is save your money because the Thanks Giving and Black Friday sales are crazy!
			
				The best times to get to the malls or outlets are around 7pm (they are normally open till 2am) or early in the morning on Black Friday at 6am. No lines, no fuss and most importantly no customer tug a war in between the isles. Christmas time is super amazing! America really does it BIG! From the giant 55 foot Christmas trees decorated with enough lights to light up a small town to the street parades, this country invests so much into Christmas. It’s truly a magical experience and if you’re over in the East Coast you will be able to have a white Christmas.
			
				New Years was pretty low key for me this year only because I fell ill with the flue but there are a few awesome New Year’s festivals across the country.
			
				 
			
				5. NBA Game Trail Blazers v.s Charlotte Hornets
			
				
			
				Getting the opportunity to see a NBA game live is such an exhilarating experience. And before you ask, yes, I bought a foam hand! The mid time breaks where the cheerleaders and dancers came out to perform really hyped up the crowd and the games coordinated with the fans really brought the whole experience to life. If you are ever feel like going to a game (any game, bball, baseball, football) use an app called StubHub or Gametime to find your tickets. Watching the Trail Blazers was such a great activity and it was such a close game 105 – 107 to the Trail Blazers. The next game I’m going to will definitely have to be a Golden State Warriors game here at Oakland’s very own Oracle Arena.
			
				 
			
				4. Afropunk Festival
			
				
			
				This festival is located in Brooklyn, New York and is a two day event made up of 5 stages showcasing an abundant of national and international musicians. Afropunk is an influential community of young, gifted people of all backgrounds who speak through music, art, film, comedy, fashion and more. A friend and I attended this festival last year in August and it was absolutely incredible. I saw so many of my favorite musicians like; Solange, Gary Clark Jr, NAO, Willow Smith, SZA, Princess Nokia, Macy Gray, Little Simz and many more.
			
				The fashion scene had me like OMFG! There so many creative people roaming the crowds in body paint, glitter, make up, hair extensions, there was this guy who had used mesh and wire to construct horns out of his own dreadlocks, that’s how cool everyone was! When you go to this festival get as creative as you can, be as loud as you can and do whatever feels the most natural. It is a carefree environment where you are able to express yourself as openly as you want to. This festival was insanely amazing and I would fully go back again. We even got to see a speech made by Spike Lee as he revealed the trailer for his new show called “Shes Gotta Have It” on Netflix.
			
				 
			
				3. New York City
			
				
			
				A few things you need to know about New York is that it is HUGE! The city really doesn’t sleep, things are really open 24/7 and the hustle never stops. We stayed in Brooklyn for the first part of our trip and fell in love with the whole Brooklyn vibe. Brooklyn has swag like no other. One thing that stood out for me was the street art dedicated to showing off its hip hop culture and history. Another cool thing to do is cross the Brooklyn Bridge but beware its hella busy so stick to the walking lanes at all times or you are most likely to hit by a cyclist. Also if you seem to find yourself a little parched once you walk to the middle, have no fear there are fruit and drink carts posted up along with sketchers and photographers ready to make your experience that much more memorable.
			
				Williamsburg is also a great little town that also has a lot of street art, local eateries and cafes along with one of the best views the city has to offer. This is down on Kent Street where you get a view of the Williamsburg Bridge, the Port as well as a view of the NYC skyline. From here you can walk over the Williamsburg Bridge into downtown Manhattan.
			
				We also did a quick visit to Harlem and it was like being in a totally different country. So many Jamaicans! While wondering the streets we came across a Carnival community concert showcasing a range of West Indies musicians. Carnival in the East Coast is a Labor Day parade/celebration of diversity. It’s a big 3 day weekend street rave where people dress up and dance. If you’re interested in seeing shirtless Jamaicans getting their “Dutty Wine” on then Carnival 2018 is for you!
			
				Times Square was also another highlight for me. If you aren’t afraid of crowds and don’t have epilepsy then this is the place for you. If you’re there to sight see then definitely go at night but if you are there to shop then go during the day. Take some tipping cash with you because you are bound to come across street shows, painters, graffiti artists, performers and people trying to promote their cd’s and music. I once was seduced by a rapper who tried to get me to buy his cd and when I declined rhymed for me as a method of flirting. Men in NYC are play in a whole other field to what I’m use to back home. I feel like the men in New York have that magic, that confidence that sweeps you off your feet. I believe it’s called ‘game’.
			
				During my time in New York I was lucky enough to visit the 9/11 memorial site and museum. This was such an emotional experience not only for me but for all the other hundreds of people who entered the facility that day. Inside is two separate sections that tell the story of what happened on the day of the attacks through narrating stories, interactive technology, archives and a collection of artifacts salvaged. It was an incredibly moving experience.
			
				 
			
				2. Concerts/Gigs
			
				
			
				One of the best parts about being here is all the shows I have been to. I really love going to concerts and festivals, raving is the best feeling especially when you have a great group who raves with you. So far apart from Afropunk, I have been to around 5 concerts and 4 festivals. I have seen the likes of Fiji, Mango Kings, Jordan T, CRSB, Sammy Johnson, Common Kings, Eric Benet, Andra Day and many more perform in the 9 months that I have been in America. I have been around for the Island Reggae Party in Long Beach, Oaklands Pride Fest, A’s Fest and have been blinded by what I saw at the Folsom Street Fair hosted in San Francisco. I normally keep an eye out on apps such as Eventbrite, Ticketmaster and Ticketfly for details and ticket pricing. I am a huge reggae fan so to see my most favorite bands perform has been a dream of mine fulfilled.
			
				 
			
				1. Oaklandish
			
				
			
				Finding my job was one of the hardest parts of my journey. When I first arrived in America I was staying at my relatives place in Riverside, California. I exhausted websites such as Monster.com and Indeed.com sending loads and loads of resumes out and getting hardly any responses back. I then moved from Riverside to the Bay Area where I found my almost full time job as a sales consultant and key holder for a locally owned apparel store called Oaklandish.
			
				Oaklandish is a B-Corp organization who uses local artists to design unique prints that represent Oakland City. Most of our apparel is design and printed in Oakland gaining credible authenticity across all apparel and products produced by Oaklandish. Partnering with non-profit organizations, Oaklandish is very community driven and annually makes contributions to these local organizations by offering support, designing t-shirts, donations and utilizing staff at community events.  
			
				I work with some pretty amazing people, some, who are also up and coming musicians and who I have had the privilege of seeing live so keep your eyes and ears out for rapper Mylez B, r&b singer Rayana Jay, and bedroom pop singer SampleLov. Working for Oaklandish has been a great way for me to learn more about Oakland and the Bay Area as well as make some pretty incredible friends. Oaklandish gave me a family, a home away from home, and by far has been the best part of my journey. I am really going to miss these guys when I return home.
			
				
				I still have 3 more months to go on my J1 journey and will most likely hit up more sites, states, concerts, restaurants and more so to stay tuned and feel free to follow me on: SnapChat: tikabell11 or Instagram: miss.tika_
			
				Also, leave a comment if you have any questions or recommendations for me!
			
				Thanks for reading!

	Oceans cover around 75% of the earth’s surface but less than 10% of the worlds oceans have been explored, there is so much more to learn. We really have only just began to understand the oceans and there is is much we are yet to learn.

	 

	6. Humans are A Real Problem

	Things people use on a day to day basis usually ends up in the ocean leading to pollution of waters and marine creatures. For example shampoos, microbeads and general waste which is dumped into the ocean and these things can have an awful effect on the oceans. This in turn is also bad for humans because we end up eating polluted fish and other marine animals. A recent study found fish in the great lakes in the United States have high doses of anti depressant medication like Prozac due to the huge reliance on anti depressants in the North America. There is the added problem of huge air pollution in countries like China and India because when the rain evaporates into the atmosphere it makes its way into the ocean.

	 

	7. So Many Inspirational People in the World

	There are so many incredible people and organisations in the world working to help the environment, animals and the planet. If you apply to volunteer abroad you are likely to encounter some amazing people who are passionate about the environment and wildlife conservation.

	 

	8. You Can Make a Difference

	By applying to join a marine conservation volunteer program you will be able to play a small role in helping, tasks can include research, monitoring, ocean/beach clean ups and rescuing and rehabilitating wildlife. Once you have been on a marine trip you will have picked up so much new information and knowledge. You will hopefully want to inform others about the problems oceans are facing and encourage yours friends and family to participate on a similar experience. You can also inform others how to live more eco friendly and sustainable, for example with recycling and reducing plastic use.

	 

	9. Climate Change is Scary

	Marine ecosystems are very fragile, just the slightest change in temperature or conditions can have a huge effect on the ocean. With rising earth temperatures, melting ice caps 

	 

	10. The World is a Beautiful Place

	Just being out in the great outdoors away from civilisation will make you really appreciate just how beautiful the planet it. This will really come to reality if you get to see some marine animals like whale sharks.

	 

	If you would be part of the solution and play a small part in helping view our marine conservation volunteer projects.

	How Volunteering aboard offered me the most incredible moments in my life, and change me as a person


	 

	Deciding to Volunteer Abroad

	Late 2017 I was searching for overseas volunteering opportunities, I had a long list for more than one organization in different cities. My 2018 bucket list was full of plans, and I decided to kick off my journey by spreading love in Sri Lanka with Plan My Gap Year. I wanted to experience the culture of this beautiful country and to connect with its people. And I actually felt like home!

	From the day I signed up till the day I left, PMGY team was very supportive in answering all my inquiries and questions. Everything was well organized starting from airport pickup , accommodation, project orientation and culture review.

	 

	Arrival

	The first part of the experience is day one when I faced what is known as “Cultural shock” but pause here! Don’t be frustrated, it’s just the First day

	When you reach you will meet lot of volunteers, the coordinators will give you orientation about the projects, the rules you need to follow and hints about the culture. I remember that I was not so comfortable, I was thinking if I’m in the right place for my vacation!

	I signed up for the orphanage project or what we call it girls home! The program was for 3 hours in the afternoon after they come back from the school, the tasks “as it was communicated “ were to help them with their studies and play with them in the greenery nature outside. But it was much more, the beautiful strong girls made it special for me , it was a “GAIN” and “GIVE” from both sides, and yes its true you gain way more than you actually give. When they feel loved they will give you more love! Their pure white hearts inspire you want to give even more, we spent 2 weeks full of happiness, laughs, dance and random smiles.

	 

	Adopting the culture is the key to success.

	Respect their culture in the way you dress and you act, If they were bare feet don’t be different , take your shoes off, Eat their food, dress the way they do, dance when they dance and practice what they love. We learn when we watch but we leave our footprints when we practice and respect

	 

	Accommodation 

	It will be your second home! You will enjoy the simple life when you are surrounded with lovely friendly people, PMGY put a huge effort to give me the real experience of Sri Lankan people life, and experience the simplicity of this country. The accommodation was basic comfortable, however few things must be taken into consideration like AC, bathrooms, hot showers which can be improved. Food was fine and they were doing their best to meet some dietary requirements for some volunteers. In two days you will feel like it’s home!

	 

	Meeting New People

	Throughout my two weeks in Sri Lanka I was surrounded with lovely people from different countries different cultures and different age groups, but we were all seeking the same objective. I met friends for life whom we shared the same room and meals with, we have also created unforgettable memories. Coordinators and volunteers were my second family, we had beautiful times during the project even in our free time.

	 

	The Real Experience

	It all starts from Day one when you set your own goals and what you want to achieve before going there. The skills you have and your life experience might really change others life so put a clear plan to yourself; my plan for the girls was to inspire and empower them to speak and allow them to talk about their dreams. Every day during my stay I was helping them to write about themselves and read it loudly so everyone can hear and know their thoughts. It doesn’t only help them to be open to their future and how they want to achieve it but also it gives them the opportunity to share their dreams and communicate a vision. However you can’t force them to do it all the time, so I managed to include some competitions, games, dance and fun time with small prizes like chocolate or snacks they love to treat them, which actually inspired them to follow the plan!

	 

	Life Changing Experience

	Sometimes change happens to you when you least expect it, These beautiful girls changed my life, they taught me how life can be simple with a smile, how you can give things that you already miss and How to appreciate these priceless moments. Their kindness took a special place in my heart and mind that can’t be forgotten over years! Love, care and strength is all what they have and they share it with you! You will learn how to appreciate and count blessings that you are taking it for granted

	Was it a real vacation?!

	A BIG YES;  it was voluntary work travel, however relaxation had also secure a spot, beautiful nature, beaches, shops and markets are easily reachable and it’s strong YES for a vacation with purpose, explore the country in your free time, plan for your weekends with your new friends or as solo traveller “as I did” be sure that the coordinators will give you all the needed support to enjoy your travel and be safe.

	 

	Plan My Gap Year project crossed all my expectations, I am passionate about helping kids and youths that was the reason I chose this project, but I have never imagined that this experience change the person inside me. YES I did it once and will repeat it again and again! Other volunteers shared their experience in different projects such as medical, mental health, turtles conservation and elephant orphanage and it met all their expectations. We spent our nights sharing the different experience from all the projects, and some got excited to do more than project a day!

	YES I HIGHLY RECOMMEND PMGY SRI LANKA PROJECTS IT SHOULD BE IN YOUR BUCKET LIST

	You have one life, it’s your choice to make it count

	Testimonials & Experiences

	"I was overwhelmed by the vast number of camp directors who had flown over to Britain to hire staff. Archery classes With so many camps, each catering with a different section of American society, to choose from, it&#39;s advisable to have an idea of what kind of camp you would like to be placed at before you arrive at the fair. As I am undertaking a degree in drama and theatre studies I decided that I would like to teach drama at camp. Each camp had its own stall at the fair, often displaying a poster listing available positions such as general councillor, drama specialist etc. By looking for camps that specified they were looking for a drama specialist, the experience became far less intimidating. Knowing what I wanted to do at camp, meant I was able to narrow my search down to a handful of camps that interested me, rather than enquiring about positions at the 300 or so camps which were recruiting at the fair."

	"I had a lot of fun at the camp fair but I attended but I didn&#39;t get hired which was dissapointing. If you find yourself in this situation don&#39;t get disheartened though - you will still get the opportunity to get placed in the run up to summer."

5 Flexible Freelance Jobs That Allow You To Travel

	Travelling around the world is usually on the wish list of everyone. However, very few can achieve this as much as they would love to.  Usually, money and time are the main limitations. Lack of money is important but, thanks to modern technologies, we now have job options that are flexible enough to allow travel whilst also receiving good earnings at the same time. Maybe you could think that being a flight attendant is one of them, but wouldn’t you prefer to fly to your own schedule rather than your employer’s?  Here are 5 great freelance jobs that you can learn and mix your passion with the places of your dreams.


	 

	 

	1. Designer

	Designing has creativity in its roots and there’s no way that we can or should avoid this. The more your mind is encouraged and challenged with visual stimuli, the more experiences your mind will have to create from. If your creativity is on fire, then all you need is the occasional fast Wi-Fi connection to video conference your clients to keep them satisfied. There are many online options for finding jobs in this area such as on the website, WebDesignJobs.

	 

	 

	2. Developer

	As of 2014, 11 million professional developers were employed worldwide and, with the arrival of the Cloud and the boom of mobile devices, this number is very likely to increase. For any software development, all you need is knowledge, ideas, and a good internet connection. Therefore, developers have great opportunities for working from home or on the road, as long as your client is secure in the knowledge that they can rely on you meeting deadlines. You can find hundreds of freelance developer roles on tech recruitment sites such as Dice.

	 

	 

	3. Journalist/Copywriter/Blogger

	Journalism has a greater quality should the topic derive from your passion. Therefore, travelling to the core place of the topic would very likely fulfil both your work objective and your travel desire. There is currently a huge demand of digital copywriters and bloggers, in particular, with freelance roles available at many leading travel websites if you send your CVs out with examples attached of your work. If you would like to work abroad and get paid as a writer get in touch with us today - we are always seeking talented travel writers.

	 

	 

	4. Community Manager

	As with Journalists, the opportunities for Community Managers are clearly favourable in the current job market; there are over 80 digital communities with more than a million users each. On top of that, Social Media is currently in a boom for any company that is looking for positioning in the market, yet employing someone full-time may be beyond their budgets if they are a smaller business. Surely it’s not difficult to imagine yourself managing community accounts of several companies whilst getting to know the world, especially if it’s in an industry that you love such as gaming.

	 

	 

	5. Translator

	If you truly want to throw yourself into a different culture, then it’s likely that you’ll become fluent at the local language; especially if you plan on travelling through South America and Mexico. Living abroad can help you develop your second language, whilst perfectly positioning yourself as a freelance translator either from or into English.

5 Reasons to Join an Adventure Bus Tour

	If it&#39;s your first adventure or you&#39;re a seasoned traveller, an adventure bus is always a good idea. Many of these buses tend to offer a hop-on, hop-off service: use it! You can explore more places, meet more people, and take more time. But which one to choose!? 


	There are a lot of options out there. Take a look at what&#39;s on offer before you buy, and see what suits you best - where they stop, what routes they take etc. For example, the Stray Travel tagline is &#39;off the beaten track&#39;, Kiwi Experience advertises itself as how &#39;youthful travellers see New Zealand&#39;, and G Adventures specializes in small-group custom made travel. There&#39;s definitely something for everyone.

	But what are the reasons for hopping on in the first place?

	 

	1. The Driver

	You might think they&#39;re just the floating head or the bodiless voice at the front of the bus, but you&#39;d be wrong.. they are so much more.

	They&#39;ll play a part in your travelling family as much as anyone else you meet - in my experience they&#39;ll join in with your activities, they&#39;ll take you to great views, show you some of their favourite spots, tell you local stories, provide all the information you need, become great drinking buddies and (perhaps most importantly) book your accommodation.

	I&#39;ve seen drivers that do spontaneous bungee jumps, snow tube like a boss, down shots on a pub crawl and have balloon making competitions on the bus. I&#39;ve been taken on walks that I wouldn&#39;t have known about and been rewarded with the most incredible views and photo opportunities.

	They&#39;ve got your back, and they want you to have a great time.

	 

	 

	2. People

	Yes, if you don&#39;t travel on an adventure bus tour you will still meet a variety of people from all over the world. But there&#39;s something about being thrown together and spending hours travelling, nights in new places and sharing new experiences with a group of people that is incredible. If you spend anything over 3 days on the same bus at a time you&#39;ll grow together, you&#39;ll become some sort of wonderful dysfunctional family.

	There was a gang of us that were from the UK, the Netherlands, Malaysia, France, Germany, Spain, Canada and America - and it was the best fun I&#39;d had.

	I learnt so much from them - from the ways of a Dutch sense of humour, to the ins and outs of Spanish politics. Unsurprisingly lack of wifi is one of the best things that can happen to you: playing card games followed by multi-lingual scrabble and a big group meal, is a sure fire way of making incredible friends and great memories.

	 

	 

	3. Safety

	Safety in numbers also applies whilst travelling. Adventure buses provide you with a feeling of safety and security when you most need it, not only are you travelling in a group so that potential feeling of loneliness doesn&#39;t creep in but, the bigger companies especially, can also give you guaranteed nightly accommodation and book you a number of activities on a daily basis. It can put your mind at rest and makes travelling that little bit less chaotic and stressful, and a whole lot more enjoyable.

	It caters to those that want an element of organisation along with some spontaneity, and also those that want all of the spontaneity without having to think of how to get there each time. With your ability to hop-on and hop-off, if you want to escape a place you feel like you&#39;ve spent one too many nights in you can just hop on again and be transported to the next stunning destination. It really can be a lifeline.

	 

	 

	4. Activities

	Adventure buses are definitely one of the best ways to get the most out of the most adrenalin packed countries in the world. There&#39;s skydives, bungee jumps, kayaking, glacier hikes, helicopter flights.. and your driver can book them all. There&#39;s so many things to do - each location comes with a different selection of activities, if you don&#39;t fancy any of them you really don&#39;t have to spend your money on them, but if you do want to do something just go for it! You&#39;re bound to regret it if you don&#39;t, and what&#39;s the point in being in New Zealand if you don&#39;t grab every opportunity with both hands?

	Some things can be discounted as part of your tour deal and you get to do it with your travelling family. Seemingly simple things like doing doughnuts in a water taxi followed by a four hour walk in apocalyptic, torrential rain can make for ridiculous but great memories. It might&#39;ve been awful at the time, but I&#39;m glad I did it now! And let&#39;s be honest, it wouldn&#39;t have happened without my adventure bus.

	 

	 

	5. The Journey

	It might sound obvious, but the locations you travel to and the journeys you take to get there make everything worthwhile. Depending on which company you travel with you can visit places you hadn&#39;t considered before leaving home and see things you hadn&#39;t imagined.

	Sure, however you travel you&#39;ll see amazing things - but by doing an adventure tour you&#39;ll get to enjoy the travelling from place to place on a bus full of friends, laughing, music, and chatter.

	There are a number of bus services available in New Zealand that can get you from place to place, and that offer nationwide passes, including; Intercity, Naked Buses, Nelson Coaches etc. These can still be used as great options for one-off spontaneous trips, especially to places your bus might not visit.

5 Reasons to Take a TEFL Course in 2016

	If you fancy exploring a different culture while earning money and gaining invaluable experience, you might want to consider TEFL training. If you’re a native English speaker you could begin an enjoyable and profitable overseas career as soon as you acquire your Teaching English as a Foreign Language qualification. Still aren’t convinced it’s the path for you? Well, here are the top reasons why you should teach English abroad!


	
	 

	1) You can experience another culture, and get paid for it!

	In the current economic climate the dream of spending a significant amount of time living abroad may seem unattainable, but by training to teach English as a foreign language you’ll be opening yourself up to a whole world of career opportunities. Compared with teaching at an international school (for which having a degree and previous teaching experience are usually basic requirements) obtaining a TEFL qualification and putting it to use overseas is relatively straightforward, and there are a huge range of employment opportunities available.

	TEFL teachers are in demand across the world, from Argentina, Mexico, Czech Republic to Thailand, so you should be able to find work no matter what nation you want to explore. And while the wage might seem low in some countries, the cost of living is also likely to be low, so don’t let that put you off. While paying for your TEFL training and flights overseas will cost you to begin with, it’s an investment that you’ll quickly see returns on as you’ll get to earn a wage whist having a priceless experience.

	 

	 

	2) You’ll have the time to enjoy your surroundings

	Often when people go travelling they have to cut a trip short or miss out on experiences they’d been looking forward to due to a lack of funds. But if you’re taking a TEFL course overseas you can choose from so many destinations! Popular locations to choose from include:

	
		TEFL Courses in Europe
	
		TEFL Courses in Asia
	
		TEFL Courses in Central America
	
		TEFL Courses in South America
	
		TEFL Courses in North America
	
		TEFL Courses in Oceania


	Also teaching English as a Foreign Language contracts typically last six months and working hours are usually very reasonable, giving you plenty of time to explore – and the cash to do it properly. You’ll also be in a position to put down semi-permanent roots, allowing you to live and work alongside local people and really appreciate the nation you’re living in.

	 

	 

	3) You can make a Difference

	The reason why people who can teach English as a foreign language are in such high demand is that many communities living in less affluent nations invest in such teachers through a desire to improve their career prospects and better their lives. While learning English can go a long way to helping them achieve their goals, speaking English will also become a skill they can pass on to their children. So by becoming a TEFL teacher you really could really work abroad and change someone’s life and make a long lasting difference.

	 

	 

	4) You’ll get to Learn

	While you’re teaching English as a foreign language your students won’t be the only ones learning. Even if you don’t intend to make teaching a full time career, a stint as a TEFL teacher will improve your communication, leadership and organisational skills while looking good on your CV. You’ll also get to learn about other cultures and peoples first hand, through constant exposure to a very different kind of life from the one you’re used to. And who knows, you may even learn a new language yourself!

	 

	 

	5) You can completely change your life

	If you want to challenge yourself and break out of your daily routine, teaching English as a foreign language is a fantastic way to do it. Whether you’re taking a gap year or fancy a career break, or just aren’t sure what to do with your life, teaching English as a foreign language for as little as six months can open your mind to new possibilities, give you an entirely different perspective and, just maybe, change your life forever.

All You Need to Know about Street Food in Hanoi

	Aggie Mcdonagh recently visted Hanoi in Northern Vietnam and has put together a guide with everything you need to know about street food in the region. She includes recommended places to eat, a 24 hour itinerary of cafes and rertaurants to visit and also top tips for batering with local street food vendors.

	 


	First of all, it is important to notice that in this vast country, there is a huge difference in food culture between North, Central and South Vietnam. Cuisine in the North is quite plain in comparison to the Central and Southern regions. Due to a harsher climate, there are fewer vegetables, herbs and spices used in cooking. That makes it really delicate and balanced, but on the other hand quite flat. So if you are planning to go on a food discovery trip the best way to start is from North Vietnam making your way south. The warmer it gets the spicier the food becomes, it is a fantastic way to indulge yourself in Vietnamese food culture that gets spicier with every step you take towards Saigon. Travelling this way gives you time to adjust and slowly discover the full pallet of flavours available in this amazing country.

	Hanoi has its own unique food market culture, and it all comes to life early in the morning and again in the evening. Often whole streets turn into big outdoor dining areas, where people of all age groups are enjoying themselves eating and talking. To really get to know it one needs to take it all in with its pros and cons. 

	There are plenty of snacks, meals and drinks to choose from but before you go off familiarize yourself with this short guide to make sure you won’t miss on anything.  

	To start your food experience journey you need to try local beer Bia Hoi (freshly brewed beer) or Hanoi Beer. This can only be accompanied by Nem Chua Ran (fried fermented pork) – it is a common Vietnamese snack and once you taste it you can never have enough of it. 

	That should be followed by any of these traditional meals: Pho (classic noodle soup), Bún Bò Huế (beef noodle soup), Bánh Bao (steamed bun with various fillings), Bánh Cuốn (rice flour rolls with filling) and Gỏi Cuốn (freshly made rice paper wraps). These are fantastic oriental dishes that will fill you up for hours especially when you are on a budget.  To finish off, an absolute must is to try Traditional Vietnamese Coffee or Vietnamese Egg Coffee- both are absolutely amazing served hot or cold and are completely different to the ones we are used to drink in Western countries.  First one is called Cà Phê Sữa Nóng (left photo) - traditionally brewed thick Vietnamese coffee served with sweetened condensed milk. And the latter one Cà Phê Trứng (right photo) is made of egg yolks whipped with sugar and poured over a shot of coffee.

	If you deem to call yourself a real extreme culinary explorer, depending on your personal views and limits you might want to try few Vietnamese ‘delicacies’ while in Hanoi. The first one on the list is dog meat (Thit Cho), it might seem disturbing for majority of us, and however it is a culturally accepted practice to eat it especially in North Vietnam. This product is mainly sold in Tay Hoi district, however bear in mind that many street restaurants in the Centre of Hanoi have it in their menu. Another unusual dish, not for the faint hearted though is a snake meat and snake cocktail. For this experience visit a snake village Le Mat and order your meal. For a starter you are served a cocktail made of fresh snake’s blood, strong rice alcohol and still pumping heart in it, that is followed by a set of dishes made to your liking from this very snake. If this is not enough, you can always try boiled foetal duck egg (Hot Vit Lon) and finish it off with Snake Rice Wine (Ruou thuoc). 

	Do you still look forward to your meal? So what are you next steps? 

	First obstacle you might come across when buying food from street vendors in Hanoi is the lack of a menu in English. This is not always the case, but you need to be prepared for this as it can be really hard to find out what is it that they sell. Sometimes equipped with a ‘Vietnamese Guide’ after a few frustrating minutes you might be able to establish what it is, however at the end of the day a good old glance into the pot is the best option. You are here to explore after all! 

	Your next step is to establish how much you have to pay for your meal. Prices are rarely displayed, mainly because they are often different for locals and for tourists. Be mindful when you barter, even though it is commonly accepted to do so. You might sometimes be in shock when you hear the first price you are being asked to pay. Also if the price you offer in return is too low the seller might get offended... Therefore it is worthwhile to do some research before you start haggling and remember when you do so that they are only trying to make their living.

	Once you decided what food you want to eat and you know how much you have to pay for it, you can sit yourself down and prepare for some culinary exploration…

	And here you might be in for another surprise…all street restaurants seem to use same type of tables and chairs, and it all would be perfectly fine if not for the size of them.  They are tiny! This is something you would expect to see in a Crèche or on children’s birthday party. Where Vietnamese can comfortably sit on them, it is a rather funny view when you see tourists trying to fit themselves on a tiny chair and eat from a tiny table having a tiny amount of space to move your hands or legs. Add to it having to be mindful of scooters constantly passing by within few centimetres from you and you have quite of an experience.

	To summarize, yes it takes time to get used to all of it. Different culture, different norms and different way of looking and things might make you feel a little bit overwhelmed at first. Some might say that eating on the streets of Hanoi is not only a rich culinary and cultural experience but also quite of a challenge in terms of menu, logistics and safety for foreigners. Undeniably though, exploring exotic dishes while sitting squashed between locals, surrounded by a city jungle with all that is has to offer bad and good, you find yourself meeting new people, having interesting conversations and exploring the depths of Vietnamese culture.

Backpacking Across America: Where to Visit And Why?

	For those of you who are considering a backpacking trip, the good old US of A is a popular choice and for good reason. Whether you’re interested in activity holidays or looking for something more relaxing, America’s 50 states have it all.


	The thing about backpacking across America is that although the country is huge, it is easy to get across. Greyhound buses and Amtrak trains offer deals and those on singles holidays can get by on little money by booking with a group travel operator.
	
	So, where to begin on your American odyssey? Think of places you want to visit, look at a map and plot it from one coast to another; it couldn’t be easier.
	
	Start off at the city that never sleeps, New York; there’s a multitude of things to do here. Head to Broadway, see the Statue of Liberty and be dazzled by the bright lights and bustling streets in Times Square. Then visit the site of Ground Zero before walking a few miles to the Empire State Building, tasting a giant slice of pepperoni pizza on the way.
	
	Once you’ve munched your way through the Big Apple, head over to Washington DC, America’s capital and home of the White House. The architecture of the state is renowned, with Union Station remarkably elaborate.
	
	Next, make your way through Virginia to Memphis, Tennessee. Essential viewing is Graceland, where Elvis Presley lived and is now buried. There’s also Beale Street (the birthplace of the blues), and the National Civil Rights Museum, built on the site of the Lorraine Motel where Martin Luther King was assassinated.
	
	From there, you’re not far from Florida, where there’s a strong Latin influence blending with American culture.
	
	As well as the many theme parks (Disney World being the most famous) you can see alligators in the Everglades, taste some delicious Sunshine State oranges and look around NASA’s Kennedy Space Centre.
	
	If French culture interests you, head over to the French Quarter in New Orleans. Devastated by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, tourists still flock to the Big Easy, famed for jazz and Creole dishes gumbo and jambalaya. Here, you can get drunk on Bourbon Street and get around on a mule-drawn carriage.
	
	Once you’re finished there, it’s hard to miss Texas. Over twice the size of Great Britain, Texas is also famous for its cowboy ranches in Dallas, many of which make fantastic adventure tours.
	
	Other things Texas boasts are: being the birthplace of singer Beyonce Knowles; and, of course, the Alamo, a fort in San Antonio, which is considered to have provided the turning point in the Texan revolution.
	
	Head from the second largest state to the largest, Alaska. With rugged beauty and lots of crude oil and gold, Alaska is home to the world’s biggest bears. It’s recommended you go here in June so you can see the midnight sun. Other activities include river rafting, whale watching and glacier tours.
	
	From icy scenes to mountains, welcome to Arizona. Of course, the most famous thing to see here is the Grand Canyon, which was carved by the Colorado River and is over a mile deep. The state of Arizona has vast deserts, which spread over into Nevada, where Las Vegas is located.
	
	Tourists come from all over the world to visit the casinos in Sin City. Another reason for visiting is the pyramid lifts in the Luxor Hotel.
	
	Nevada is right next to California, another must-see state. Mingle with the rich, famous and beautiful in LA, marvel at the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, and explore the amazing Yosemite National Park. Plus, wouldn’t you like to visit the state in which Arnold Schwarzenegger was elected as governor?
	
	After all this, you’ll probably feel you’ve earned a few days doing nothing, so spend some time relaxing and catching rays on Venice Beach, before taking your flight back home.
	
	The land of plenty has much to offer, boasting a variety of attractions, historical sites and activities that can be incorporated into your ideal trip. Whether you’re looking for good value, family-friendly locations, or good old-fashioned fun; go test the American dream.

Best Summer Travel Ideas for Students

	The legendary summer break is as popular as ever and what’s more, the opportunities on offer continue to become more diverse with each year that passes. If you are a student or soon to be graduate currently looking to make plans and want to get your summer sorted check out our top fun ideas for things to do including traveling, adventure, working or learning abroad. 


	Uni life can be exhausting and it is important to get your summer prepared in advance so you don&#39;t waste 3 months being bored. Where you go and what you do can be decided by money, but there are also lots of free and cheap summer travel ideas for students in the UK and all around the world.

	There are also lots of cheap holiday destinations for uni students and ways to travel during summer without breaking the bank. Check out our top 10 things to do for students during summer below.

	 

	1. Work Abroad

	

	Working holidays are always popular, with short term jobs abroad for students and graduates in destinations all around the world. Traditional favourites of becoming an au pair, fruit picking, teaching English as a foreign language (TEFL) and humanitarian or conservation work. The latter can be paid but is more usually on a volunteer basis. Some charities also offer gap year students the opportunity to gain a qualification or training in a particular area, such as sports coaching. 

	Recommended Ideas:

	
		Work in Canada
	
		Work in the USA
	
		Work in New Zealand
	
		Work in Australia


	 

	2. Summer Camp USA

	

	Working at a summer camp in the USA is our top recommendation! This is a job which is a lot of fun where you will get paid to live and work at a camp in America. Companies like Camp Leaders, Camp America, BUNAC, Americamp, CCUSA and InterExchange offer camp counselor jobs in the USA and Canada, get your application in early to stand the best chance of getting hired.

	 

	2. Campsite Seasonal Jobs

	

	Like the idea of seasonal jobs in Europe? Campsites and holiday camps employ a huge number of staff during summer months and are a fun and enjoyable way for young people or students to spend a season in the sun and warmer weather. The country with the highest demand for staff is in France but campsite jobs are also available in UK, Austria, Denmark, Norway and other countries throughout Europe. Campsite courier jobs include cleaning tents and caravans, greeting clients, introducing the facilities and local attractions and dealing with any problems such as illness.

	Bigger campsites also require resort representatives, nannies and childcare helpers, entertainers and sports instructors. Free accommodation in tents or caravans is usually provided. When is seasonal work in campsites and holiday camps available? Contracts are often for full or half seasons between April and September. Posts are usually filled by Easter so it is best to apply early. However, last minute places are also available. Some places also offer holiday rep jobs.

	 

	3. InterRail

	Like jeans, many summer adventures never go out of fashion, such as travelling through Europe by train, known as InterRailing. Eastern European countries such as Albania and Romania have become the new territories to explore instead of traditional ones such as Morocco and south of France. New flights have made many destinations much more accessible for those who only have a short time to explore. Likewise, other continents have opened up to gap year students, such as Australia. With no language barrier to overcome, work is relatively easy to come by Down Under and it remains a favourite among students.

	 

	4. Gain Experience

	

	Applying for internships and joining a placement might not sound like the most exciting way to spend your summer but your future self might actually thank you. This can help you in the long term with job prospects and might help you get a dream job. There are short term summer internships abroad in destinations all around the world where you will get to boost your CV and go sightseeing in your spare time,

		Internships in Australia
	
		Internships in USA
	
		Internships in Europe
	
		Internships in Asia
	
		Internships in South America

	Looking for a unique and rewarding experience? Do something meaningful through international volunteering programs abroad. There are lots of different projects available worldwide for both short and long periods. You could help work with communities or contribute to environmental programs.

Europe Gap Year


	 

	Europe Gap Year

	

	Europe is a historic continent to visit on a gap year and every country offers something different. We help thousands of people plan gap years in Europe every year and there are so many different ideas, adventures and gap year programs available. Gap year jobs in Europe are very popular but there are lots of structured experiences and trips. The hard part is deciding where to go. 

	There are no specific reasons why you should take a gap year to Europe, you could be finishing school or university and not sure what to do after? Maybe you just want to do something different and travel? You could be stuck in a dead-end situation and need a fresh challenge? On One World 365 you can find gap year programs in most European countries. Where you go really comes down to personal choice, most programs can be joined from 1 week, whilst some can last over a year. 

	There is a real difference between booking a week’s break somewhere in Europe and soaking up the place and it’s culture, and going somewhere for several months with a purpose; getting into the way of life and its people. Participating on a gap year program in Europe isn’t about doing the wildest things you can possibly think of all day for a year. Many opportunities require that you work on a designated project for a period of time, giving you some ownership in tasks and requiring you to mix with locals. All of this is good for jolting you out of a rut, if you’re stuck, or growing your confidence if these are you first steps in to a bigger world.

	If you decide to take a gap year in a European country, at your doorstep is a multitude of cultures easily accessible by budget flights, buses and trains. Not only that, but pricewise, accommodation is on the low end when compared to some other continents. Whether going for a weeks or longer, it has been made so easy to do. With such a variety of history and entertainment, there is no shortage of places to go and things to do. Meaning it makes little difference whether your trip is with friends, a partner or by yourself. Unsure quite where and when to go? There are so many different experiences available in countries throughout the continent.

	If you would like to spend your gap year working in Europe you can search lots of positions on our directory. From short term summer jobs to fixed long term placements you have a lot of choice depends on your skills. Where you go and what you do really depends on your own interests, you might like to view our featured jobs above to get started. 

	After a gap year in Europe you will be able to impress your parents and friends with new - found culinary skills, tales of all the challenges that you overcame – home sickness being one of them, and oh so important map - reading skills. Seeing Europe first hand gives you unparalleled knowledge about other cultures, religions and mainly about people. This is a great opportunity to become attuned to how other countries live and it is undoubtedly a culturally rich experience to visit different countries across the globe. Our programs are open to UK/EU citizens whilst we also process enquiries from people from Australia, New Zealand, USA, South Africa, Canada and other worldwide destinations.

	 

	 

	"I would highly recommend volunteering to anyone looking to stay away a little longer and do something special. I initially applied for the experience and to help, and by the end of my placement I had made friends for life." - Kate, UK

	"The experience taught me that age and nationality are of little importance and that you do not have to spend money to have fun or see something beautiful. I made friends for life. Voluntary is about the people". - Hannah volunteered in Greece with Concordia

	"I worked with teenagers aged 14-17, they were mostly Russian speaking Estonians, but there were also teens from other countries. It was an excellent experience, I learnt a lot, particularly about the experience of the teens as Russians living in Estonia. It was also very interesting to meet and work with the volunteers from all over Europe (I was the only English volunteer). We got on well and I hope to keep in touch long term with some of them". - Caroline, English project in Estonia

	"I will definitely do it again next summer , it was an unforgettable two weeks" - Aliya, UK 

	"Tours in Europe are great when you don’t know where to go, what to see, but sometimes you don’t want structure. Sometimes you want to explore, get lost, see how the locals live; this is where a tour company such as EF College Break is a good choice. These are educational tours for ages 18-28.  Sure they have fully guided tours as well for those that wish for a more structured holiday, where as College Break provides just the right amount of “me time”. One day you can join a tour of the Palace of Versailles, the next you hop on the Metro and wander to the Champs Elysee with your new friends/roommates." - Sasha Mitsch

	"I did a 23 day tour around Europe with TopDeck which I would highly recommend to everyone." - Matt, New Zealand 

	"My advice to anyone contemplating travelling alone in Europe is to try a tour. It’s a great confidence booster and well worth the money you pay. It was hassle free as all the important things were taken care of, and it also meant I was seeing all the main attractions at each destination but still having the opportunity to do my own exploring and finding hidden treasures of my own. All you need to worry about is deciding which trip to go on." - Karyn Hicks, UK

	"If you are looking for a wild party with no sleep and friends for life choose a tour with Contiki. When I was living in London I booked a few tours in Europe with Contiki and they were honestly the best time ever. They are just easy and save you a lot of time and effort." - Liz, Australia

	"I got my TEFL certification in Spain with TtMadrid which I really recommend. The course was intensive but the friendly staff made everything easier for us to learn and improve. TtMadrid reviews are very positive, they help you right from arrival!" - Sanj, India

	"Working on the project was a unique experience – I hope to do many more. Everyone should be a volunteer!" - Ruth, festival project participant

Fiji: An archipelago of contrasts

	The Yasawa Islands of Fiji are full of contrasts. The Fijian archipelago sits in the Pacific Ocean, 1,300 miles north east of New Zealand, and benefits from spectacular scenery, a temperate climate and friendly locals. These attributes draw visitors from across the world, and for a number of reasons; whether it’s for a relaxing holiday, a stop on a round the world tour, or a romantic getaway, the Fijian islands have something to offer everyone. 


	The best way to experience Fijian culture is to island hop. The easiest way to do this is to book through a tour operator who will tailor a package to suit your requirements. The group of islands known as the Yasawas are easily accessible from the port of Denarau and a designated catamaran runs a hop-on hop-off service most days. Tour companies may offer a stop at one of the three Mamanuca islands; South Sea is a tiny uninhabited island fulfilling the utopian ideal with its white sands, palm trees and clear blue sea. It offers fantastic diving as well as the option to sail by schooner to the island where Castaway was filmed, and visitors are encouraged to sample Kava, a Fijian drink extracted from plant roots.

	Each Yasawa island has its own characteristics and qualities. The island of Kuata is perfect if you are looking for a traditional Fijian experience. The accommodation comprises of a large dormitory style room situated within the main village, allowing visitors to live as part of the community. The facilities are basic but more than adequate; hot water on the islands is rare so expect cold showers! Taken on face value, Kuata doesn’t appear to offer much entertainment, however there are activities available that give a real taste of island life. Kuata is dominated by monolithic mountains, so climb through the forest and take in the spectacular panoramic views across the Pacific. Follow this with volleyball on the beach, or eat fresh watermelon with the locals. There is also the opportunity to learn how to create jewellery using natural materials and traditional methods. Evenings on the island are not to be missed; food is provided by the village and is usually in the form of a buffet serving a variety of traditional Fijian cuisine. On certain nights, the locals partake in cultural dance and encourage visitors to join in. 

	Manta Ray Island offers a different experience altogether. Situated in the ‘Blue Lagoon’ region of the archipelago, the island is visually stunning, with palm fringed beaches meeting colourful coral reefs. Diving and snorkelling are the main attractions here; the clear seas allow an unparralled insight of life in the ocean, with a variety of tropical fish and reef systems. The island derives its name from the manta ray, a species common to the surrounding waters depending on the season. When rays are spotted, the resort sounds a siren meaning a boat trip is departing to the area they are occupying. There is then the chance to swim with the rays, which can grow up to four metres in length. Be quick though as the boat doesn’t wait for long! In contrast with Kuata, the accommodation is a purpose built resort with dorm rooms, but it fits perfectly with the natural surroundings. The bar is set into the hillside, allowing visitors to admire the amazing sunsets whilst enjoying evening drinks. 

	Finish the trip with a visit to Beachcomber Island. With a reputation as the ‘party island’, Beachcomber contrasts completely with the calm of Kuata or Manta Ray. It is the ideal destination for a final get together as the island is geared towards ensuring people have a good time. It is also the place to go for water sports; try parasailing or gliding for fantastic aerial views of Fiji. However this is not the island for people who like their own space; the accommodation comprises of one huge dorm room that houses 100 guests so don’t expect a lot of sleep!

	Fiji has something for everyone, so plan your trip to incorporate the islands that best suit you. Whether you want to relax, party or increase your understanding of a different culture, the welcoming locals and beautiful environment make Fiji a unique experience.

	I travelled with Awesome Adventures Fiji on the 12 day ‘Tropical Awegasm’ package.

France TEFL

	We have put together some useful information about sights you can see and places you can visit when taking a TEFL course and studying or living as a English teacher in France. If you are hoping to take your English teaching skills across to Europe, you could not go too far wrong by checking out all that Paris has to offer. Not only is it under three hours away from London by train, but you will be visiting a city which is compact enough to fit into a long weekend and one which has culture by the bucket load.


	A Guide to Teaching English in Paris, France

	 

	Travelling to Paris from the UK is as simple as getting on a train. The Eurostar has regular services which stop slap bang in the centre of Paris. You could visit for just a day or two or stay for a longer period. If you are checking out Paris with a view to staying permanently, then the Eurostar is a great way to travel to and from the two countries. If you are travelling on a student budget then you can still find accommodation which will suit your limited means or check with your language school and they should be able to help. If you have more money to spare or it is a special occasion, then romantic or luxury boutique hotels are easy to find.
	
	If you are visiting just for a weekend to see if Paris would be a potential destination for you to teach English for around £70 a night you could stay at the Hotel Beaumarchais in the heart of the city. It is close to the Picasso museum and has everything you would expect from a standard hotel room. The rooms are a good size and are painted in nice bold colours. Even cheaper is Le Village; a 25-room hostel which boasts views of the Sacre Coeur from its Montmartre location. While you will be sharing a room, a kitchen and the bar area, the friendly atmosphere of the hostel is something to cherish. If you have a little more to spend, then you might like to try the Murano Resort, which is described as an urban resort complete with a restaurant and DJ bar. The interior has been designed by Raymond Morel and features silvers, reds and a minimalist style. Think Phillipe Stark in terms of the furnishings and take the time to relax in the pool and spa area. This is perfect after a tiring day of sightseeing.
	
	When teaching in France, the heart of the city where the true Parisian experience can be had. Nearly everyone will be familiar with most of Paris’ tourist attractions; but seeing them with your own eyes is something else entirely.
	
	The Eiffel Tower cannot be missed. While the crowds may put you off, a trip up the tower is worthwhile. Built in 1889 for the World Fair, the tower was almost torn down in the early part of last century, as it had served its purpose. However, it was only saved because it was being used for holding antennas for broadcasting. Now it boasts more than six million visitors a year, who either climb their way or take the lift to the top for the amazing views. For something a little more modern, the Centre Pompidou is a sight to behold. The modern art housed within the centre is one thing, but the building itself is testament to the skills of the architect and designer. With the painted pipework showing the innards of the building on the outside, it is an artwork in its own right and can be enjoyed without even having to step foot inside.
	
	A visit to Paris is never complete without a visit to the Louvre. While the queues may stretch round several corners, the wait is certainly worthwhile. To see those great works of art up close is something which everyone must experience and the Louvre does not disappoint. Even those who have little knowledge of art cannot fail to recognise the odd painting or drawing from its vast collection. Of course the Mona Lisa is its most famous resident and should not be left off the itinerary. Even if you choose not to visit one of the many attractions, you can easily find yourself drawn in by the general atmosphere of Paris. With the Seine running down the city&#39;s middle and a number of ornate bridges crossing at regular intervals; the city is beautiful and interesting at any time of the year.
	
	You can usually find a market or two where there are an abundance of cheap statues of the Eiffel Tower to take home, or you can buy a crepe and sit by the riverside taking in the views. Paris is a city renowned for its artists and is full of students and young people. Simply watching the world go by is worth the price of the ticket. Of course, food in Paris is wonderful. The restaurants offer standard French cooking and the best wines and it is easy to find great deals for lunchtimes and evening meals. Street cafés permit outside eating and small intimate restaurants are scattered throughout the side streets. You will be spoiled for choice. The Au Pied de Cochon is famous for its onion soup and its cheap full breakfasts, which are served throughout the week. Or, if you are brave you can try the pigs’ trotters! Prices range from €7 for a starter to €35 for two courses. For dessert, head to the Berthillon for its 70 flavours of ice cream. You can get four scoops for just over €5; enough to share.
	
	Paris is a wonderful place to visit and could be a great place to work as well. The abundance of visitors from around the World makes it perfect for English students or teachers who want to experience a different culture; even if it is just for the weekend.

Gap Year Guide FAQ and Advice

	What is a gap year? A gap year is a break from study or work which usually lasts three months to one year. People of all ages take gap years, many young people in the UK tend to take a gap year prior to or following college or university...


	A gap year can include a period of change from living in your home country, to travelling the world undertaking work, volunteering or just exploring. In the UK a gap year when leaving school and before entering higher education is a now a very popular transitional choice.
	
	Even more common is the number of 28 - 40 year olds now taking what is known as mature gap years.
	
	Mini gap years commonly last for a period of six weeks to three months and with the current economic climate more and more people are considering taking time out from jobs, and going on career breaks worldwide or getting experience in between jobs.
	
	Many employers now view gap years as a positive learning experience. A lot of large institutional employers allow employees to apply for unpaid sabbaticals whilst even government departments, for example in Canada allow staff to take 12 month break every five years.
	
	Going abroad is not a necessary component for a gap year, there are thousands of opportunities in countries around the world, for example in the UK you could volunteer with the National Trust or even just have time off work to relax and do something different than the normal 9-5 working routine or you could learn a new skill which will be beneficial to your future.
	
	There’s an exciting new world out there and we’re going to help you explore it!
	
	There are currently over half a million people taking gap years every year, so what are you waiting for?
	Why taking a gap year could be a good idea:
	
	* It improves confidence and broadens your personal experience
	* It demonstrates that you have a proactive, inquiring nature
	* It&#39;s an opportunity to immerse yourself in another culture
	* Possibly become fluent in another language.
	* It can improve your chances of future employment
	
	Why people take a gap year
	
	By the time most students have been to college, the average eighteen-year-old has spent most of their life in full-time education. With increasing pressures in education it is no shock that a growing number of students and non students alike are now choosing to take a break.
	
	For many, a year out can provide the time and space needed to analyse their skills and decide which university and course will allow them to reach their full potential.
	
	Will a gap year / career break be right for me?
	
	Anyone considering taking a gap year, should have the desire to do something different. Want a challenge, and a life changing experience, Do you want to make a difference in the lives of others Perhaps you are feel the time is right to take a break from working and challenge yourself to do something different and worthwhile.
	
	Whatever your age, present employment or ambition, a gap year offers you the chance to do something different which may change your life for the better.
	
	Members of the British royal family have taken gap years. Prince William and Harry chose to have a gap year before beginning his university course. He travelled and gained a variety of new experiences. He undertook a number of new activities during his year, including preparing for survival exercises with the Welsh Guards in Belize, working as a volunteer in Chile, working on a dairy farm in the UK and visiting countries in Africa. Prince William said the favourite part of his gap year was working at a dairy farm in the UK as a farm labourer rising before dawn to milk cows and performing “mucky jobs” along with everyone else thus being treated as an equal. Prince Harry impressed by his brothers experience also took part in a gap year in Africa, helping with building works, assisting in a classroom and playing football with village children.
	
	What are the benefits of gap years?
	
	Most universities view a year out positively. Employers echo this and feel that if the time is spent constructively it can enhance a graduate&#39;s skills, experience and knowledge. A gap year well spent can open your horizons to a new world whilst improving personal and professional skills and can help shape the direction for a future career.
	
	Gap Years - Potential Drawbacks?
	
	You may find out that time away is not best suited for you. If you are planning on going to university it is highly recommended that you check with the universities and course departments to ensure that a year away is fine with them before you commit yourself as some are not too keen for their prospective students to postpone for a year. As well as learning new skills, experience and making friends some people find it hard to motivate themselves or get lonely and homesick.
	
	Gap Year Volunteering
	
	Volunteering as part of your gap year can provide you with a structured and meaningful gap year experience. Volunteers are usually aged 16+ and come from all over the world. Volunteers usually pay their own way, receive no salaries, and are often both a positive and essential ingredient in the success of projects.
	
	By volunteering you can make a positive impact on a project, person or even change your outlook on the world. Try to get as much information as possible especially from past participants who will be able to give you advice about companies and projects. There are a wide range of volunteering possibilities available, from teaching English, to being part of a community building project you can make a difference to the lives of others while gaining an amazing and rewarding experience for yourself.
	
	Why pay to volunteer?
	
	If you have been researching volunteer organisations you might notice that some of the placements are quite expensive. This is usually because the price includes the admin of setting placements up, air fares, accommodation and back up and support whilst you are away.
	
	These all inclusive voluntourism packages are great for a first time traveller or someone who wishes to gain a unique perspective on a new culture through volunteering. Many trips offer a combination of volunteering with a tour or other activities.
	
	If you are a seasonal traveller, volunteer or have specific skills you also have the option to apply direct to a local project, or NGO where volunteering can be free or low cost. In some cases you can be offered free accomodation or meals in exchange for your time and efforts. If you choose the independant path In this scenario you will often be required to make your own travel arrangements and provisions for your trip.
	
	Gap Year Considerations
	
	Voluntary work always looks good on your CV as you could gain vital experience which could help you in your future career. Voluntary work can be quite emotionally and physically challenging, while for others it can be a life changing experience.
	
	You don&#39;t necessarily have to go abroad to volunteer, there are plenty of opportunities in your native country. Time of year is something to bear in mind, due to climate, time of year companies employ temporary workers and seasonal working.
	
	Some organisations may require you to volunteer for a certain period of time, so be flexible. In a lot of placements you will not need any experience to volunteer, your own interests and skills can be more important than qualifications. You could approach charities or voluntary organisations direct by looking up their details.
	
	Gap Year Work Abroad
	
	Working or studying abroad during a gap year is getting easier all the time as business and educational organisations go global. All it takes is a little planning, the right contacts, some background knowledge and you&#39;re on your way.
	
	Gap year jobs can set you off on a new adventure whilst funding it as you go along. Each country has its own educational and qualification system which means that qualifications cannot always be easily used in a different country.
	
	You will need to decide what kind of gap year work you want to do. There are several options including seasonal jobs, permanent work or you could volunteer for work experience. Remember though working abroad isn&#39;t like going on holiday, jobs in exotic locations may sound appealing, but in reality you may not even have time to step foot on the beach!
	
	Gap Year Study Abroad
	
	Studying abroad on a gap year is a great way to integrate into a foreign culture, learning a new language, experiencing the cultural differences whilst being a great learning experience. You might find both the academic and social aspect of studying and living abroad a lot more enjoyable if you know the native language. There&#39;s no better way to speed up learning a language than to be live with locals in a country.
	
	If you&#39;re considering taking a course that&#39;s taught in the native language - law or business studies for example, be aware that this can demand a high level of fluency. Consider too, that if you&#39;re struggling with the demands of the course it, then struggling with the language may be an extra pressure you could do without.
	
	Gap Year Preparation
	
	If you choose to travel abroad and want to do so independently a lot of preparation and planning will need to go into the trip before setting off. You will need to organise your finances, visas and any vaccinations required for certain countries. It is often best to arrange all gap year volunteer, work and travel placements prior to departure as availability may be limited on arrival.
	
	Gap Year Fundraising
	
	Last year in the UK more than one million pounds was wasted and was left lying around in bursaries and grants unclaimed. If you live in the UK and are looking to raise money for your trip, go to your local library and ask to view the Directory of Grant Making Trusts. This includes organisations such at the Rotary club and the Round Table which in specific cases may have money available. Useful websites to visit include: www.bmycharity.com and www.justgiving.com.
	
	Gap Year: What you need to think about:
	
	Decide what particular volunteering experience you would like to pursue?
	How long do you want to volunteer for?
	Do you want to gain experience for a career or just an amazing experience?
	Where should I go?
	
	Try to put together a short list of continents and countries you would like to visit and get advice on travel message boards or consult and travel agency.
	
	Some gap year highlights we recommend:
	
	* Trek the Inca Trail to Machu Pichu in South America
	* See the mystical Ayers Rock, Australia
	* Sunrise at Angkor Watt, Cambodia
	* Do a jungle trek in northern Thailand
	* Trekking in the Himalaya, Nepal for example
	* See the big wild animals on safari in Africa
	* Thrill seeking adventure sports, New Zealand
	* Experience carnival, Brazil
	* Walk on the salt flats, Bolivia
	* Drive route 66, USA
	* Nearer to home in Britain or Europe
	* Inter-railing through Europe
	
	Sample Gap Year Round the World Route
	
	A popular choice for gap year participants is a round the world ticket. With this ticket you can choose which countries you visit, a sample route could be London - Delhi - Bangkok - Sydney - Auckland - Fiji - New York – London, so long as you keep going in the same continual direction.
	Accommodation
	
	Research and book accommodation in advance.
	
	Guide books can be a helpful but be aware that good places go bad and bad places go bust. A little flexibility and an ear to the travellers grapevine can turn up some real gems.
	
	Be aware that availability can be limited especially during events / national holidays so avoid leaving it until the last minute.
	
	If you availability is tight, you need to do some legwork to find a bed for the night and you&#39;re in a group why not someone stays with luggage at a safe place e.g. restaurant or internet cafe while others do the rounds. Yomping round a busy place on a boiling hot day with a backpack is no fun at all. Where you stay can vary enormously according to your trip type, destination, travel group and budget. Hostels can be great places for meeting other travellers or getting info. Homestays can be arranged in many places and are a great way to meet local people and provide insight into a culture. There are websites and organisations to help arranging these.
	
	A little extra cash for the occasional up-market hotel can open a range of options that might provide a memorable highlight during a trip.
	
	Booking Gap Year Flights
	
	Try to shop around for the best deal for flights, there are a huge range of choices and prices available. If you are travelling round the world it might be an idea to book a flexible ticket which means you can change the itinerary at any time. Be-aware of costs / restrictions in making changes to your ticket and carry contact details for your airline in case your plans do change. Consult a travel agency for more information.
	
	Gap Year Money / Budget
	
	Carry a variety of payment methods including ATM cards, travellers cheques and cash (local currency and dollars/euros/pounds).
	
	Popular ATM cards (visa, mastercard etc) are accepted worldwide these days but its worth checking in advance as availability of some card types can be problematic. Be aware that cash machines in remote locations can be out of service, out of money and money exchange counters / banks can be closed because of a public holidays. Have a plan b and c in case your primary payment method isn&#39;t an option.
	
	If you get stuck worldwide money transfer services (western union) etc can be a lifesaver although there are fees.
	
	Gap Year Budget
	
	As a rough guide, Asia is probably the cheapest continent to travel; you can survive on an average budget of around £5-10 per day which includes accommodation and food. Australia and New Zealand budget for around £25 per day. In Europe you might need as much as £30 per day. In North America try to budget for around £20 per day whilst in Central and South America you can get by on around £15 per day. USA, European Capitals, Australia, Singapore, Rio de Janerio and the Carribean are places where additional funds will make life easier and increase your range of options although costs can still be kept down by staying in Hostel dorms, travelling overnight and cooking yourself. Consult a guidebook like the lonely planet for advice on costs on your destination.
	
	Gap Year Travel Insurance
	
	Don’t think about going abroad without travel insurance. When planning a trip insurance might seem like an expensive luxury, but when you are away anything could happen to you or your belongings so it is best to be covered as medical bills could be very costly indeed. If you are taking expensive items eg camera, laptop or planning extreme activities such as skydiving, trekking, climbing etc it is worthwhile. Check Insure and Go.
	
	Gap Year Visas
	
	Once you know which countries you want to visit, check the embassy / foreign office websites for advice about visas, vaccinations, safety and any restrictions.
	
	Gap Year Advice
	
	Research your destinations thoroughly; get advice from the foreign office (fco.gov.uk)
	
	Be aware to the customs of your host country, try to learn about the laws, customs, sensibilites and appropriate dress code
	
	Make an effort to learn some of the local language - even a few words are often warmly receieved and basic familiarity can make practicalities like travel arrangements, finding directions, ordering food etc much easier. One of the real pleasures of speaking the local language is being able to speak with people - to learn of their lives and share a bit of your own.
	
	Gap Year: What to Pack
	
	Passport, plane tickets, travel insurance, visas, photocopies of important documents such as your passport, basic first aid kit, travellers cheques, contact details, clothes and memories of home to avoid homesickness.
	
	Take several copies of important documents - leave one at home with a family member / friend and store another in a safe place online. That way if you lose everything a trip to the internet cafe or a call home can help get you sorted.
	
	A few suggestions for items to consider taking on a gap year…
	
	A robust pair of walking boots / trainers / sandals / flip flops, torch, mosquito net, compass, insect repellent, sunglasses, camera, music, a first aid kit, needle cotton and spare buttons for fixing clothes, a blanket for overnight bus journeys, a sheet or sheet sleeping bag for unsavoury stopovers in cheap hotels, a chain and a couple of padlocks to secure luggage, an outer cover/bag for your rucksack to prevent tampering or opening, a small travel alarm for early morning trains / buses...
	
	Most products / brands are available in your destination (or there will be local equivalents) and often things you may require will be cheaper than at home.
	
	Travel light - its much better to acquire additional things rather than being burdened with a heavy, unwieldy bag. Shipping stuff home can cost a small fortune.
	
	If at all possible avoid buying heavy / bulky souvenirs early in your trip - carry that stone / bronze sculpture for months might not seem like such a good idea after a while.
	
	Gap Year Dangers / Risks
	
	Watch out for scammers, tourist traps and troublemakers. While the majority of people you will encounter will be kind hearted, generous and hospitable be at least a little skeptical of new "friends" (locals and other travellers) especially if they approach you. Often in Asia these are commission seeking travel agents or touts who will resort to any means (and will not take no for an answer) to get you to stay at their (brother/uncle/friends) hotel, ride in their taxi/rickshaw or buy their excursion at a premium.
	
	Always be on your guard for those who would commit crime against your person or part you from your belongings - travel in groups is a safe option especially at night, in remote places and also in popular tourist locations.
	
	If you participate in drugs be aware that the consequences of your activities can be severe including lengthy jail time often in horrific conditions. Also the cost of your recreational activities or habit extracts a terrible toll on local people who in many instances are forced to endure pollution, violence and exploitation by armed gangs as a result of drug production and trade.
	
	Drinking alcohol can cause offense in certain parts of the world and even in more liberal places intoxication can result in all sorts of problems including lost belongings, accidents or even jail.
	
	"Sexual tourism" or involvement with prostitutes is often exploitative and carries risk of sexually transmitted disease. Avoid.
	
	Be prepared in advance if you are visiting an area experiencing severe political unrest, armed conflict, problems due to the drugs trade or terrorism.
	
	Speak to other travellers to get advice on known risks / scams at your next destination.
	
	Above all, don&#39;t be paranoid, human beings can be very generous, hospitable and helpful but do be aware and awake to potential risks.
	
	Gap Year Arrival Advice
	
	Book your first nights accommodation in advance and check for any festivals or large events that might make availability a problem. Also have an idea about how to get from the airport to your hotel before arriving - arrival in a foreign country can be very confusing especially after a long trans-continental flight.
	
	Take time to acclimatise and to familiarise. Arrival in a new place can be exciting and bewildering. Try if possible to avoid doing too much for the first couple of days. Changes in temperature, altitude and diet will require adjustment. Short walks at altitude, protection from hot sun and dehydration and moderation of diet until the stomach has adjusted to local cuisine can all help ease you into your new adventure.
	
	Speak to people on arrival and to get advice / recommendations. The best tips usually come from people who live in, have visited or currently are travelling in your destination.
	Staying in touch
	
	With the advent of the internet (which is widely available worldwide) the world is increasingly well connected and communicating has never been easier.
	
	* Set up an free web based e-mail account eg hotmail, gmail, yahoo etc
	* Get an internet phone account with Skype which is widely available at internet cafes
	* Get a local SIM card for your mobile
	* Use social network websites eg facebook
	* Create a blog and document your journey and the people you meet

		Phnom Penh - The capital of Cambodia where there are many sobering reminders of the Khmer Rouge’s devastating rule during the late 1970s. It is estimated that over a million people deemed a threat to the party were killed as part of Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge’s regime. A memorial dedicated to those who were executed during the genocide can be found at Choeung Ek, the location of one of the many killing fields. This harrowing mass grave site is still littered with human bones
		 
	
		Sihanoukville - You will find some of the best beaches in Asia along the Southern coast in and around Sihanoukville, they are also less touristy


	 

	 

	

	
		Gap Year Tours & Backpacking in Cambodia
	
		We recommend joining an organised overland trip to make the most of your experience in Cambodia. There are lots of different options available for both short / long gap years and also various budget options too. There are lots of small group tours which you can join all year round, taking a tour will be an incredible journey where you will have experienced guides and meet new people from all over the world. Organised group trips are also a lot of fun and a fresh new experience, they are perfect if you are planning a gap year or career break. If you are worried about travelling solo in Cambodia you might want to join an overland trip booked with an international operator. You can travel around Cambodia on public transport which is very cheap but a little unreliable, always try to plan ahead too as when you arrive in a destination you will be swarmed by tuk tuk drivers offering to take you to hotels, hostels or anywhere you fancy.
	
		
			 
		
			 
		
			
	
	
		Gap Year Programs & Work Experience Placements in Cambodia
	
		There are lots of work experience and placements to choose from, you can make a real contribution to a local community during your stay learning a lot about both yourself and Cambodia. Projects can be found in places like Siem and Phnom Penh and include teaching English at local orphanages, working with communities to advocate women’s rights, and helping to care for children with mental and physical disabilities. These projects are made even more rewarding by the positivity and kindness of the Khmer people, despite the turmoil of the recent past. Lots of people join gap year volunteer projects in Cambodia every year, popular options include teaching English where you can help lead lessons and have lots of fun working with children. Most programs will require you to be aged 18+ and be in good health. No knowledge of the local language is required to participate but we recommend learning some basic phrases if you are going to be working with people. Unless you are doing a professional placement like medicine no previous volunteering skills are required.
	
		 
	
		 
	
		
	
		
			Cambodia Gap Year FAQ
		
			
				Getting There: Cambodia is only a days drive from Bangkok and you can also fly with Air Asia fairly cheaply, this is a good country to visit if you would like to travel the loop around South-East Asia.
				 
			
				Visa: Depending on your Nationality you should be able to apply for a visa online in advance and be allowed entry into Cambodia as a tourist. 
		
		
			
				Safety: Cambodia is a very safe destination despite widespread poverty so don&#39;t let safety / crime put you off visiting. You will get to experience culture and really interact with locals who are really friendly and will greet you with smiles. 
		
		
			
				Budget: This is one of the best value destinations in the world and a lot cheaper than Thailand. There are cheap hotels, hostels and guest houses located throughout the country. Cambodia is a very cheap country to travel, possbily the cheapest in South-East Asia but always shop around for the best prices on trips and accommodation. Learn local phrases to barter for prices on the markets, some words like expensive and cheaper will come in handy. Also exchange your Reil before deparing, it can be a nightmare to exchange once outside of Cambodia.
				 
			
				Accommodation: Hotels and Hostels are fairly cheap in Cambodia and you really get what you pay for. On the cheapside you can get a bed in a dorm room for around £2.50 - £4 ($3 - $5), for mid range you can get a private hotel room for around £5 - £10 ($7 - $12) and if you spend more you will get en suite, color tv, air conditioning and a really good room. You should need to spend more than £15 - £20 per night to get a really good room.
		
		
			
				Food: The food in Cambodia is suprisingly tasty, expect rice, potatoes and meat in most cafes / restaurants. Don&#39;t be affraid to try something new whilst there are lots of Western food available too. We recommend visiting a local restaurant in Siem Riep and trying the Khmer curry which is really tasty, street food is good to eat and also cheap, you can view people cooking it in front of you so you will get an idea if anything takes your fancy. Some local Cambodian food delicacies can be a bit unusual, for example you can eat cooked spider!! if you are feeling adventurous maybe give it a try.
				 
			
				Crime / Safety - Cambodia has suffered from a terrible brutal past under the Pol Pot regime which is still fresh in the memory but this country is incredibly safe to visit and we highly recommend planning a trip. There are some dangers and annoyances to watch out for including pickpocketing which can be a problem in places like Phnom Penh. Always try to travel with someone especially at night and let others know where you are going if you are travelling off the beaten track. Try not to drink too much and try to find your way home too, be a responsible tourist. This might be one of the poorest countries in the world but local people are very friendly. 
				 
			
				Health & Safety: Yellow Fever is the only requirement for entry into Cambodia but there are others you might want to think about getting before departing. Others to think about getting include diphtheria and tetanus, hepatitis A / B, polio, rabies and typoid. Try to drink lots of bottled water in Cambodia, we don&#39;t advise to drink the tap water. Cambodia can get quite hot and humid during summer so its very important to stay hydrated. Malaria is a problem is some rural area&#39;s and so you might want to get medication, it is usually very rare for people to catch malaria in Cambodia though. You might also want to take a mosquito spray and net with you, sometimes you can get eaten alive by the insects in this country. Never have unprotected sex with a stranger or local person, its very common for local women to chat tourists up but always be aware they might want a fee, or have a disease. Always carry condoms with you and be on the safe side. If you have any serious medical problems whilst in Cambodia we recommend travelling to Thailand, Singapore or Hong Kong for treatment, here you will get a better level of healthcare and facilities. Always buy travel insurance so you are covered.
		
		
			 
	
	
		 
	
		Tips & Experiences - What to Expect from a Gap Year in Siem Riep
	
		My friend and I arrived in Cambodia after a month in Thailand, and there was a noticeable difference between the two countries as soon as we reached the border crossing. After the usual border control procedures we got in a taxi with another passenger (a talkative Australian man with a cowboy hat), and embarked on the journey towards Siem Reap – the gateway to the Angkor temples complex. It’s around a 3 hour ride on bumpy roads, and stands in stark contrast to the developed travel industry of Thailand, but it gets you to where you need to be. One tip is to limit the amount of water you consume as toilets did not feature on our excursion, except behind bushes. Many of the hotels in Siem Reap provide accommodation and transport deals to and from the Angkor temples, and your tuk-tuk driver will be waiting to take you there each morning. You can choose to get a 1 day, 3 day or week pass to explore the Angkor area; we opted for 3 days ($40) which was about right for us.

	Guide to Taking a Gap Year in France

	Ok, so you know you want to spend your precious gap year in Francce - you know a little bit of the language pretty well and you love the culture. As it’s extremely difficult to decide where to go and what to do when the world is your metaphorical oyster, you should be congratulated on narrowing down your chosen destinations to one! Whether you’ve decided to join a structured trip, or you’re more into the idea of a bohemian backpacking adventure, it’s probably a good idea to start your gap year off in a relaxed fashion. There are lots of cheap hostels available throughout the country in places like Paris but you might want to book yourself into a more expensive hotel somewhere for a few days can give you time to acclimatise and get ready for the next stage of your adventure. You’ll be surprised at how inexpensive you can find hostels and hotels, depending on when you book - if you go off season you could bag yourself a bargain and start your French gap year adventure off in style! But where do you go and what do you do? 

	 

	 

	

	Gap Year in Paris

	Paris is a city the young romantic dreams about. The perfect place to escape the hustle and bustle of the daily grind with your loved one. However, Paris’s allure doesn’t end at romance. Armed with a few friends, one change of clothes and a camera, Paris proves equally as enticing to the single traveller, as our featured travel writer Naomi Richardson found out by herself, below you can view here top 10 things to do on a gap year visiting or working in Paris...

	 

	1. Wander Down the Champs Elysees - The Champs Elysees. Think Oxford Street on acid. It’s big, it’s bold and it’s beautifully French. There’s the Arc de Triomphe at one end and La Grande Roue at the other, creating the perfect blend of modern and old. The street is littered with activities for the rich, ranging from designer shops to a Haagan Daaz restaurant.
	 

	2. Eat Croissants for Breakfast Everyday - As simple as this sounds, the croissants in Paris are second to none. Take this opportunity to explore different boulangeries and the variations on offer; once you’ve discovered your favourite you’ll never find one as perfect ever again.
	 

	3. Visit the Lovers Bridge - Regardless of one’s relationship status, the Lovers Bridge over the Seine River is a must-see in Paris. Spend a little while reading some of the messages and, if you feel so inclined add your own. The perfect reminder that romance isn’t dead.

	
	4. Go up the Eiffel Tower at night - Yes, The Eiffel Tower might be a little cliché, but if you head up once the sun has set the experience completely changes. The lights from Paris create the most incredible views and are well worth the queue time. If you’re feeling really flash, you could even purchase a glass of champagne at the top to celebrate the achievement of getting up there.
	 

	5. Listen to a Local Band - Even if you struggle to understand French, singing is still beautiful regardless of the language. Head over to a pub on the outskirts of the city, grab a drink and enjoy an evening of new music. You’ll be embracing everyday life of Parisians, rather than the classic tourist route.
	 

	6. Wander Around Paris After Midnight - As a city, Paris comes to life at night. The French adore their late night eating and partying and it would simply be rude not to join in. Wander the streets (in a group, of course) and soak in the party atmosphere – it’s a buzz you won’t get anywhere else.
	 

	7. Make a Picnic of all Things French - Head to the local supermarket and load up on baguettes, brie, Orangina and everything else you associated with France as a child. Find one of the many beautiful parks, settle down in the sun and people watch; the perfect activity to relax after running around the city.

	
	8. Visit the Louve and Other Attractions for Free - Many of the best tourist attractions in Paris are free for EU members between the ages of 18-25 – something I didn’t realise until my own visit. If you’re only there for a short time, some of the queues may put you off but it’s worth going into at least one of the landmarks; when else will you get to see the Mona Lisa for real?

	
	9. Go to as many Bars in the Latin Quarter as Possible - The Latin Quarter is well known for its bars and nightlife. What makes it special, however, is each bar is unique in its own way. We made our way around quite a few but became extremely fond of a particular one which we frequented two nights in a row. The staff are always incredibly friendly in each bar and revel chatting to foreigners, sharing stories of their own travels.

	
	10. Don&#39;t be afraid to venture outside of Central Paris - Yes, the Eiffel Tower and the Notre Dame are incredible. But they’re not the be all and end all of Paris. If you restrict yourself to the main attractions you miss out on the side street cafes, the smaller events occurring, the snippets of real life that occur in the city. Go for a wander and lose yourself in the beautiful city that is Paris.

This applies if you are planning to just travel or if you are looking to work.

	Best Places to Visit on a Gap Year in New Zealand

	If you have at least 2-4 weeks you should be able to see both the North and South Islands which are both different. We highly recommended trying to see:

	Wellington - A relaxed capital city with a scenic red train, you can tour the parliament here

	Queenstown - The adventure capital of the world

	Wanaka - Mountains, scenery, skiing and a nice atmopshere

	Auckland - A sprawling city with lots of activity

	Roturua - The local hot springs are the attraction, this location can smell strong though!

	Off the Beaten Track - There are lots of other places too, don&#39;t be afraid to go off the beaten track e.g. Milford Sound, Invergargil and Napier. There are two giant glaciers - Franz Josef and Fox - that end only 250 metres above sea level. Be sure to also visit the blowhole at Punakaiki.

	Fiordland - Enjoy breathtaking scenery in Fiordland, visitors can sail through the steep mountains in chartered boats or kayaks or hike along the trails among the thousands of waterfalls or, best of all, fly over the granite peaks and dark, deep water. Waterfalls cascade hundreds of metres into the deep water and dolphins are the tour guides for kayakers. Fiordland National Park is a UNESCO World Heritage site and includes Milford Sound, which Rudyard Kipling called the eighth wonder of the world. Hiking is the best way to see more of the scenery and the area has three of New Zealand’s Great Walks. Hikers can go to Sutherland Falls, which is the tallest waterfall in the country.

Pinot noir grows well in this area and the wineries are open for tours and tastings. The Central Otago Rail Trail is 150 kilometres that follows the old rail tracks and there are resting places at the old-time stations. This area is very secluded and visitors enjoy finding themselves alone among the thousands of wildflowers in Alexandra. The area includes the Moeraki boulders, which are 60 million years old perfect spheres.

	Dunedin - Known as the Edinburgh of New Zealand because of its Scottish heritage. The city has well-preserved Victorian and Edwardian architecture as well as one-of-a-kind wildlife habitats. The rarest penguins in the world are nearby as is the only mainland breeding colony of Royal Albatross in the world. The Larnach Castle is the only castle in New Zealand and is perched on a hill overlooking the Otago Harbour. Dunedin also has Cadbury World a chocolate factory with chocolate shop.

	Canterbury - There is no end to the activities in this part of South Island. Thrill seekers will be happy to never leave with bungy jumping, white water rafting, surfing and skiing all on the same day. The highest peak in the country, Aoraki Mount Cook as well as Arthur’s Pass National Park, both have excellent hiking activities. For a relaxing meal in a first class restaurant, visitors go to Christchurch - the Garden City. The buildings in the centre of the city were partially destroyed in an earthquake in 2011, but the welcoming locals and excellent city vibe has not been touched.

	Marlborough - The home of New Zealand’s famous Sauvignon Blanc, Marlborough is on the northern tip of South Island. There are over 40 vineyards to visit. Visitors can also explore the Marlborough Sounds by kayak, charter cruises or luxury yacht.

	Gap Year Tours & Backpacking in New Zealand

On our website you can find gap year tours in New Zealand where you can travel both the North and South Islands, these types of trips are a great way to meet new people and see places you might not normally see travelling solo. Usually accommodation is included in the prices which vary depending on the tour you join. Local people speak English and so booking trips and transport is easy. You can pre-book tours, there are lots of trips with departures all year round. There are also other options like hiring a car, motorbike, campervan, catching public transport or joining overland hop on hop off bus trips which are very popular with gappers. If you like a town, city or place you can stay for as long as you like which is ideal for any gap year. If you want to see somewhere remote try to visit areas surrounding Dunedin in the South Island. St Clair beach is stunning and relatively un-touristy, you will not be disappointed if you enjoy relaxing on white sandy beaches.

	This country is a very easy country to navigate and ideally you&#39;ll need around a month to see as much as possible, it might be an idea to hire a car or meet people at a hostel to travel with if you are looking to get off the beaten track. On official trips you will be with experienced guides who know the best places to visit, they will be able to tell you lots of information you might not otherwise find out and can really improve your experience. This is one of the many highlights of booking an overland experience but try to book before departing as spaces can fill up quick. The public bus service is very reliable and will certainly be able to connect you to most towns and cities at low prices. If you hire a car or campervan its best to shop around for the best deal, also check notice boards in hostels as there are always travelers looking to sell their vehicles. There are also trains and internal flights but if you want to see as much as possible we don&#39;t really recommend these modes of transport. For trains check out Tranzrail or Jetstar Airlines / Air New Zealand for cheap flights.

	Top Tips for Taking a Gap Year in New Zealand

	
		General Information - If you allow around four weeks to visit New Zealand that should be enough to visit most of the main tourist attractions. Base backpackers in Auckland has a hot tub on the roof which has amazing views at night. The South Island is generally more fun and lively than the North, head to Queenstown for nightlife. Wanaka has amazing skiing and winter sports, it&#39;s also in a spectacular setting. Try to enter pool competitions at hostels, you can win amazing prizes like bunji jumps, trips and excursions.


	
		Renting Own Van - It&#39;s quite cheap to rent or buy a van and most of them have been adjusted by previous owners so that they now include a double bed and serve as a mobile home. And it´s quite handy that you don&#39;t have to build a tent after a long hiking day. Be careful where you intend to spend a night though, since most of the land is privately owned and the rest (parking lots, picnic spots) are being checked by local authorities that they´re not being used as a camping spot. But have a look at DOC campsites - these are some basic camping places where you can spend a night for free or for some minimum fee, they provide toilets and water, some of then even showers etc.


	
		Budget - If you are arriving from Europe or Australia you should find New Zealand cheaper than these destinations, things like buses and accommodation can be slightly cheaper. New Zealand is located a long way from anywhere and your best option for getting here might be a round the world ticket, sometimes this is just a little bit more expensive than a return flight. Try to avoid visiting during peak season where accommodation can be booked up in advance and more expensive than off peak. You will also find the main cities like Auckland and Wellington are more expensive than the rest of the country. Another money saving tip is a lot of hotels and hostels charge to use the internet and this can be expensive. An alternative is to visit the local library or go to a local coffee shop, lots now offer free wifi. There are lots of good deals you can get on bus trips to explore more of this country, lots of companies operate and you can also book in advance to save money. Also think to yourself how much you really want to and need to see, sometimes the day trips and excursions can end up costing more than the North / South island trip itself.
		 
	
		Accommodation - Accommodation is cheap, generally hostel dorms are your cheapest bet, they cost around £10 - £20 ($15 - $25 USD). If you are planning on staying somewhere for more than a few days you might also be able to work in the hostel in exchange for free accommodation, these types of hostels can be found but generally off season. Hotels are usually around £25 ($40) per night and again in the main cities this will be more expensive. You could also rent your own campervan, try couchsurfing or try a program like WWOOF which allow you to work in exchange for free accommodation. Recommended to book hostels and hotels in advance during peak season when most tourists visit. 
		 
	
		Food / Drink - This country is a very developed and there is a wide variety of food available. You can find cheap buffet restaurants like Chinese and Japanese and there are usually good deals on lunch offers. Eating dinner out can be expensive, expect to pay around £7 - £12 ($15) for most meals. There are a lot of fast food outlets which are cheap but even this can add up, it is also really unhealthy to eat this everyday. If you are going to stay in a hostel most have world class facilities and clean kitchens so you can prepare your own food. Our top recommendation is to find a local supermarket and buy your own food, this will save you a lot of money every week. Bars usually have great deals on beer during happy hour, usually around 4 - 7. Sometimes you can get a huge container with four beers in for less than the price you would pay for one normally. Expect to pay around £1.50 ($3) during happy hour and £3.50 ($5) out. Also if you are drinking alcohol on a daily basis this can eat away at your budget so try not to drink too much.


	
		
			Crime / Safety - New Zealand is the adventure capital of the world but please check you buy the right insurance policy, some do not cover dangerous and extreme sports. Please also apply lots of sunscreen, New Zealand has a thin ozone layer and has the worlds highest death rate from melanoma. Crime is relatively low but please be street wise and don&#39;t flash valuables in public. Always lock valuables in hotels and hostels. For emergencies dial 111 and you will be put through to the emergency services like the police, fire brigade and ambulance services. If calling from an international mobile phone please dial 112. Natives are extremely friendly and welcoming, you might want to get to know more the history of the islands and learn about Maori culture. 
	
	
		 
	
		 


	
		What to Expect
	
		English speaking natives who are very friendly, lots of adventure sports like bunji jumping, sky diving, glacier walks and more. New Zealand is quiet compared to Australia for example, the population of New Zealand is around 4 million which is smaller than London! Most people really enjoy travelling in New Zealand, the scenery made famous in the Lord of the Rings films is spectacular. Michelle from the Czech Republic had this to say about here time here "I´ve just came back from New Zealand and looking at the pictures that I´ve brought back I still envy myself that I&#39;ve been there."


	 

	 

	Past Participant Feedback

	Three years ago, Hannah Rose was in her fourth year of college decided she was going to find a way to mix her dreams with reality, she wanted to travel and explore but on her own terms. Hannah wanted to have an adventure and decided to take a gap year between college and the real world. Here she shares her successful three step plan to achieve your dream experience…

	"First I bought a ticket. A friend and I decided that we would gap year in New Zealand. We wanted to work so we needed a country that spoke English and would give us free visas with no hassle. Perfect. After deciding the where, I needed to figure out the how. Yeah I would work once I got to New Zealand, but how was I going to get there. I was a broke college student who heavily relied on her parents for income. I stopped eating out, partying as much and I saved. The moment I had enough for a one-way plane ticket, I bought one. I was once again broke but I had a ticket going somewhere and four months to find the money to make it happen. I moved in with my parents and took a summer job. I worked long hours, at a summer camp I didn&#39;t fancy too much, but it paid well and I got to be outside daily. It worked. 

	Second I made a plan. I&#39;m the girl who plans every step and every conversation that she will have over the next three days. I get anxious not knowing what I will be doing everyday of next week. So while being spontaneous when traveling is a great idea it will never be my reality. And while I know this about myself I also know that life doesn&#39;t work on a schedule, nor is a scheduled life a life at all. Now I had a ticket to a fantasy and an obstacle in the way. I fixed it. My friend and I made a plan. We created a list of everything we wanted to do, everywhere we wanted to visit. We gave ourselves two months to backpack, explore and WWOOF our way through the two islands. Hostel rooms were booked, couchsurfing accounts set up and WWOOFing arrangements made. Roughly two months into our trip we planned to settle down in Wellington and find jobs. I knew a family who lived their and could give us the stability I figured I would need by that point. I saved what I thought would be enough for two months of adventure and still have a sufficient amount to pay bond on a  decent apartment once in Wellington.

	Third I threw the plan out the window. On September 4, 2012 I boarded a plane with one friend, one backpack and one destination and flew around the world to the unknown kiwi land. Our first week followed our schedule and from their our trip unfolded. Six weeks into the trip I was done living out of a backpack, never showering and I was ready for a routine. While this might not sound thrilling and adventurous to some, it was just the adventure that I wanted. I spend ten and a half months based in Wellington getting to know the local culture, cuisine and people. I took side trip to explore what I hadn&#39;t yet seen and spent the rest of my time hiking and picnicking locally. I never held back and pushed myself just enough.

	When my visa ran out and I was forced to come home I was sad but so thankful. I had done the impossible. I had accomplished a dream of mine successfully and with no money. Throughout our youth we are constantly told to travel, to take advantages of our lives while we have no responsibility. To do it while we can. However being constantly told that the time is now, doesn&#39;t change the fact that traveling, moving or even trying something new is scary. It is. But it is worth it. My advice, do it, and do it your way. You can listen to people and get advice but when it comes down to it, it&#39;s your life and you jetting off. Make yourself comfortable and confident and then allow room for change. Take a look at what you want out of life and who you really are and what you want to be. Then find a way to combine it all. Whether you travel across the world or across cities lines, give it your all, but do it your way."

	 

	 

	Itinerary Ideas for the Perfect Gap Year in New Zealand

	An island nation on the corner of the map; culturally akin to the Pacific Islands of Fiji, Samoa, and Tonga; dwarfed by that “other” Australasian country… yet on a scale our featured writer Leona Duff was completely unprepared for. Here she shares her experiences...

	Perhaps this speaks to my own naïvety, but being from England - urban England at that - I’ve been spoilt by our well-developed infrastructure and truly miniscule size. This is what I’ve come to appreciate in the short time I’ve been staying down under.

	I landed in Auckland just over two months ago, and as the country’s biggest city there was no cause for concern to start with. I knew I had to head down to Dunedin by the end of the week for work, on the south island – the south of the south island. If going by “land”; which was my choice having just got two long haul flights out of the way; this meant catching a ferry across the Cook Strait. When I asked at the office [of the host agency -support services for those like myself on working holiday visas] how this worked/how it would fit around the rest of the journey, I never thought it would involve booking hostels along the way.

	Three coaches, one sea voyage, five cities (with numerous rest stops along the way) = three days.

	An American might scoff at this, but it was new to me. Auckland to Wellington takes 12 hours alone, and it was there I stopped for the night. Early next morning, I caught the ferry to Picton (3 hrs), where the next coach met me to carry me to Christchurch (6 hrs). Another stopover before the final leg to Dunedin (& another 6 hrs). Granted, if you can drive yourself then you can take a more straightforward route, but it’s fair to say I saw a fair bit of the country in this time, with the landscape gradually changing from sub-tropical to temperate. I started adding to my list of places to visit - Taupo and Kaikoura particularly caught my eye. The list has only got longer since.

	This is where I should make note of the practical things: I travelled with Intercity Coaches (whose routes cover the length and breadth of the country), and Interislander Ferries (whose main competitor is Bluebridge). Public Transport is privatised in New Zealand, so there’s a vast array of companies with differing services, much of it localised. Now I’m in Dunedin, I’ve learned that Atomic Shuttles are the cheapest to go with for travelling between here, Christchurch, Queenstown, and Invercargill. The only passenger trains between cities are run by Kiwi Rail, and these are on very restrictive routes. Each of these options is also limited by frequency (usually twice a day) and space. To get to the more remote areas, which – let’s face it – are what this country is famed for, you have to hope there’s a tour company offering packages through your area of interest.

	Basically, it’s a country where it really pays to know how to drive. I’ve never needed to before (and I’ve not quite worked my way up to hitchhiking, despite how safe the country is considered). Even then, the roads are of a slightly different nature than you might be used to. Void of traffic, yes, but if you venture away from the highways then you’re likely to be facing some very gravelly surfaces. But then, that’s got something of a romanticism all its own.

	Guide to Taking a Gap Year in the Philippines

	When visiting The Philippines you will probably fly into Manila which is a huge city, there isn&#39;t that much to see and do here do try to get out and see the rest of the country. If you have some spare time going to the mall is really the main distraction you can find in Manila by day-time once you have been to the very few touristy places! But not all malls are equals. The "Mall of Asia", the third largest mall in the world (the two bigger ones are in China) and its a different way to spend an afternoon watching local people buy goods. Recommended destinations to check out on a gap year in The Philippines include Cebu, Borocay, Bohol and Palawan. Safety shouldn&#39;t be a problem, you should be able to take local busses without any problems but always try to travel with someone and keep an eye on your belongings.

	 

	Top Places to Visit

	
		Manila, its a big sprawling city and you will most likely fly into here. Try to visit the famous mall which is the 3rd biggest in the world!

		Borocay has some amazing beaches with pure white sand
	
		Malapascua island which has lots of dive sites and centres which offer beginners courses

		One Hundred Islands National Park


	 

	Budget

	Some things can add to the price of your gap year, island hopping is an amazing experience but this will hit your budget. Accommodation on islands like Borocay will be more expensive than other less touristy destinations. Accommodation is generally priced at £1 - £5 for a dorm bed, a private / double hostel room will cost around £5 - £10 per night whilst a hotel room is priced around £15 - £25. You can also stay in guest houses, home stays, beach bungalows or if you are really trying to save money try a website like Couch Surfing. Food and drink in The Philippines is very cheap, you can eat street food for less than £1! Fast food outlets, cafes and restaurant food shouldn&#39;t be any more than £3 - £8.

	 

	Past Gapper Feedback

	“Now I am slightly biased here in that my family is from Cebu (although I was born and reside in England) BUT I promise you it is such a beauteous island with the most accommodating people you are likely to encounter dare I say, anywhere in the world. Well I spend the majority of my time in Cebu city itself due to family. I would highly recommend this if you crave a real sense of the ‘true’ Philippines.”

	What to Do on a Gap Year in Singapore

	One of our featured writers Sally Taylor recently visited Singapore and below she shares her tips and experiences for what you can do in this destinations...

	With only 2 days in Singapore, and 1 of those dedicated to indulging my inner child at Universal Studios, I had a mission: to see as much as possible in just 24hours! The good news? It&#39;s definitely doable; you&#39;ll get a real sense of the playful but uber-modern Asian vibe of this city-state in no time at all. The bad news? You&#39;ll find it hard to leave so soon! I could have happily spent another day or two here, and have included some suggestions at the bottom if you have more time to play with (lucky you!).

	Firstly, getting there. While you could fly, the easiest and often cheaper way is to take the bus. It&#39;s coach travel, but not as you know it! We got a super comfy, air conditioned coach, with copious leg room and even DVDs playing, for less than the cost of a budget flight. It takes around 4-5 hours from downtown Kuala Lumpur, though it&#39;s best not to  any connections too close to your expected arrival time, as immigration, traffic or the number of toilet stops your driver decides to make can all bump up the time! Crossing the border is easy - your driver will tell you what to do and when, just be sure to get back on the right coach! At the first checkpoint you just have your passport stamped, then at the second you put your bag through a scanner. Much less hassle than airport security!

	The main bus terminal is on Beach Road, and there&#39;s an MRT stop (Nicoll Highway) less than 10 minutes walk away to take you into the city. There&#39;s no ATM there though, so grab some dollars when you get off the bus. Like in Hong Kong and Kuala Lumpur, the MRT is fantastic: easy, fast and frequent. A single trip is around $1.30.  We stayed in Chinatown where there are a lot of accommodation options very near the MRT, from bustling backpackers to flashy five stars. It being near to Chinese New Year this vibrant district was even more colourful, with giant decorations and lanterns lining the streets. There are hundreds of well-priced places to eat, as well as supermarkets nearby.

	The next day my sightseeing mission began with a free walking tour of the city&#39;s Little India. You don&#39;t have to book, just head to The Verge shopping centre for 10am (opposite the Little India MRT stop) to meet your guide. Ours was June, a very enthusiastic and knowledgeable Singaporean who was full of facts and anecdotes about this buzzing district. Even if you don&#39;t make the tour, be sure to visit the area; having stayed in a few different Chinatowns (including, err, actual China) it was really exciting to immerse ourselves in all things Indian.   Shopfronts hung with gorgeous saris and flower garlands, piles of fragrant spices and booming Bollywood tunes - it&#39;s an assault on the senses! The tour lasted around 2 hours - be sure to do the polite thing an tip your guide when you leave!

	After the tour we hopped back on the MRT to Orchard Road, Singapore&#39;s shopping mecca. It&#39;s a seemingly never ending avenue of fancy department stores and shopping malls that are architectural wonders in themselves, and window shopping is a great way to work up an appetite for lunch! Eating on Orchard itself comes at a premium, but a little nosing around inside one of the many malls and you&#39;ll find lots of cafes and food courts to choose from.

	After a quick bowl of laksa (delicious!) we took the MRT to Esplanade, and one of Singapore&#39;s best known sites, the famous Raffles hotel. Named after the fantastically-named Sir Thomas Stamford Bingley Raffles, the founder of Singapore, this beautiful colonial style hotel has been open since 1899. Tourists are welcome to wander around some areas, but if you want a drink at the bar be sure to dress nicely! It&#39;s also not far to walk from Raffles to Marina Quay to see the Merlion, the half lion, half mermaid statue that is the symbol of Singapore, and marvel at the impressive skyline.

	We had dinner in Chinatown then walked to Clarke Quay, though there is an MRT stop and plenty of restaurants there too. Clarke Quay is where Singapore goes for a night out, with all different kinds of bars (including the ubiquitous Irish pub) lining both sides of the waterfront. If you&#39;re after a Singapore Sling, which of course we were, be sure to shop around! It would&#39;ve set us back nearly $25 at Raffles, but we found a bar overlooking all the action at Clarke Quay where they were buy one get one free. And very tasty they were too!

	So concluded our 24 hours of sightseeing. I would hugely recommend a visit to Universal Studios, on Singapore&#39;s playground, Sentosa Island, where we spent our second day. Again just a couple of MRT stops way, get there early and stay til the parade at 6pm (at least!). If I&#39;d had longer I would have loved to visit the new River Safari, a waterbourne wildlife experience where you can see pandas, manatees and a whole host of other rare creatures. I&#39;d also have checked out the Night Safari (can you tell I like animals?) which does as it says on the tin, taking you on a night time tour to see everything from bats to big cats up close after hours. Sentosa Island also has 4 or 5 other theme parks to check out, if your inner child isn&#39;t tired yet!

	A fantastic flying visit that left me hungry for more - thank you Singapore!

	Safety Advice & Local Laws

	One last and final step revolves around the beautiful city of Singapore, which is infamous for its clean nature. On the spot fines are common, especially from some behaviours that we tolerate here in Britain, so make sure you aren’t caught chewing gum on the trains or littering. And not to take the sparkle out of the Asian jewel, nor to assume that these behaviours are something that travellers may take part in, but it’s worth mentioning that the death penalty is in use for offences that include murder and drug trafficking.

For many students, this would be the ideal mix of work and travel, all the while enabling them to fund it themselves and experience something completely different.

	It’s possible to work your way around the country in hospitality, for example. There are many websites that will help you get a waitressing, catering or bar job somewhere in Spain, which can then kick start your year of adventuring. It is possible to pick up casual work this way and fund your adventures backpacking. If teaching is your thing, then you could find a place teaching English to adults or children, again there are plenty of programmes to help you find these. You will most likely need a TEFL qualification and once you have this it will also open up many avenues to you for further travel in the future. Positions can be found at language schools, summer camps and leading private lessons.

	 

	 

	Backpacking in Spain

	Spain is a great country to learn to surf or live for a longer period and take part in an exciting gap year program, each area of the country offers a different experience, you could experience one of the many great year round festivals, spend time exploring cities or even travel through more countries overland in this region. Some people head South to Morocco whilst you can also join trips on a gap year in Portugal. A lot of people learn Spanish in Spain, there are Spanish classes and language schools in places like Barcelona, Madrid, Valencia, Málaga, Salamanca and Seville.

	These are just a few of the activities on offer though, you could volunteer or join an organised overland adventure trip. On our website we have featured gap year programs available which can be joined all year round. For these you will usually need to pay a fee which covers placements, transfers, accommodation and meals for the duration of your stay. To apply for a gap year program you will need to be eligible for a tourist visa, most Nationalities are able to apply. It is best to book a couple of months in advance to, this is a popular year round destination and spaces can fill up quickly.

	It’s best to do a lot of research and planning before leaving on your gap year, take note of working requirements for example, and cover your communications well. Making sure you have a good data roaming plan on your phone is a good idea, as you can get caught out with huge bills just for hopping online a couple of times. Being safe is just as important as being adventurous so make sure you’re always in contact with someone back home if you’re travelling alone, or get a group together of trusted companions for extra safety - and fun!

	Spain Gap Year FAQ

	
		Visa: If you come from the UK you can enter Spain for free as this country is an EU member state, all you need is a valid passport. If you are visiting from outside of the EU you will need to check to see if you are eligible for a tourist visa
		 
	
		Airports: Most cities in Spain are connect to airports in Europe and destinations worldwide. You can get really cheap flights with low cost airlines if you book in advance.
		 
	
		Accommodation: There are a high standard of hotels, hostels and guest houses located throughout the country, prices are quite cheap in comparison with other European destinations. Spanish accommodation is medium priced, generally a hostel dorm bed will cost you around £10 ($15) per night, if you go in winter or out of summer you will pay less. Try to book accommodation well in advance as its much cheaper. A private room in a hostel or hotel will cost you around £25 - £40 ($35 - $50) per night and it really depends on where you are. In Barcelona, Madrid and Valencia are more expensive than smaller towns and cities. An idea if there is a couple of you travelling, instead of staying in a dorm book a twin room this sometimes is cheaper especially if you stay more than a few days. 
		 
	
		Cost: Spain is a very good value for money destination, accommodation, food, transport and sightseeing. The more expensive places include Barcelona and Madrid which are the two main cities. One of your biggest costs will probably be drinking alcohol so if you can avoid / cut back on this you will save a lot of money. You will probably spend less money on a gap year in Spain than other countries in Europe, accommodation and food seem cheaper and there are lots of way to save money. Some places in Spain are a lot more expensive than others, for example IIbiza during summer can cost you a  fortune, hotels, food, drink and going out is really high. Whilst other destinations like Benidorm are a lot cheaper.
		 
	
		Food & Drink: Spain has some of the best food in Europe, there are usually great deals on lunch time where restaurants cut the prices. Try the local paella and seafood you won&#39;t be disappointed. Spain has really tasty food, paella is a local favorite but isn&#39;t to everyone tastes. Expect to pay around £5 - £10 for a meal in a restaurant ($7 - $12). Please note if you get drinks, beer or cocktails with your food you can easily spend £20 ($25). If you are looking for cheap food out, lunch is your best bet, most of the Spanish people eat really late at night so restaurants can be busy and overpriced. During lunch there are usually good deals on meals with rates slashed. If you are looking to save as much money as possible then get your food at supermarkets or local markets, you could make sandwiches and fruit which will work out a lot cheaper than eating our everyday.
		 
	
		Transport: Spain has a quick and efficient transport network meaning you can travel throughout the country relatively easily. Transport is fairly cheap but you have to remember how big a country Spain is, we recommend taking the bus to get around which will save you a lot of money but the journey time will be longer. Buses are safe and there are also cheap overnight services. Trains are quick but very expensive. The metro in cities is cheap too compared to cities like London, usually a single trip costs around £1 - £1.50 ($1 - $3). You can also join a gap year tour


	
		Health & Safety: Spain is a very modern country and has world class hospital and health facilities but please always buy travel insurance to be on the safe side. There are no specific vaccinations you will need to enter Spain. Petty theft and pick-pocketing is a problem in some places in Spain, be careful around tourist hot spots like La Rambla in Barcelona always keep an eye on your belongings. On party islands like Ibiza burglaries are a problem, try to keep important belongings like your passport and money in a safe in reception. When there are festivals and celebrations like New Year always keep your bag / camera in sight, lots of people watch fireworks for example and then open their bag to find belongings gone.

	What to Expect from Taking a Gap Year in Sri Lanka

	Sri Lanka is a truly beautiful nation where you can find so much diversity in nature, architecture and culture within only a few hundred kilometres. Read what you can expect from traveling in Sri Lanka from our featured travel writer Dean Bennell...

	Colombo is a busy, bustling and jam-packed city where the traffic is never light and people are always on the move. Yet within it’s circle you will find shanty towns through to expensive apartments and glorious hotels set within the old colonial walls of the Dutch and the English. In this busy city you can still find a coastline to watch the sunset from, with locals thriving on the community feel of life on the sea wall. Travel a few hundred kilometres north to cities such as Polonnaruwa and you will find ancient city ruins, tucked aside next to a thriving new town - a real mixture of the best of both worlds. From here you have national parks only down the road and a whole host of local towns and villages, packed with culture, community and history. The beauty of Sri Lanka really comes alive in the hill country, where Kandy (considered Sri Lanka’s ‘second city’) is found, tucked away amongst vast forests and tea plantations. From here you can visit sanctuaries and a whole host of temples and statues. Head south of Colombo and you will see a whole new natural world; beautiful beaches and countryside, still feeling the effects of the 2004 tsunami, but still adapting a different feel to Sri Lanka altogether.

	Yet the best thing about Sri Lanka is it’s people. The people here are driven by their beliefs but also driven to work incredibly hard, at a time where many in the whole world are reeling from the current economic climate. In the United Kingdom, it can be safe to say that many people do not realise how lucky they truly are. How lucky we all are to have a supportive state system - such as the NHS, social housing and welfare. How lucky we are to live in a country that is a world leader in terms of human development, supported by vast organisations, propped up by multinational companies and in turn, allowing the people to live in luxury in comparison to poorer world nations. The words ‘third world country’ have been dotted about by some UK residents during it’s struggle through recession but to those that tend to write to their local newspaper and complain to local councillors about things like pot holes, waiting two hours at a walk-in surgery or moaning about only two million pounds being spent on a bus station - they seem to be lost, sadly, and forget about those in the UK that are truly in need as most people just walk on by with their heads down worrying about their own needs. We are lucky to even have anything.

	The roads in Sri Lanka are chaotic and pot hole ridden. The journeys take hours. The hospitals, doctors and dentists are only for those who can afford it. There is no red tape, no health and safety - just common sense and community. Despite many living in poverty, begging on the streets, the Sinhalese are perhaps the nicest and kindest people that I could ever meet. My companion on my travels has a prosthetic limb and the kind-hearted treatment that he receives from everybody is truly inspirational; and I have never seen anything like it. Locals tell us that many lost their limbs during the thirty year civil war here and something like that is even more life-changing and agonising out here as they do not have the same facilities as we do at home - we are lucky to have systems such as the NHS and the opportunity to receive such help when we need it most.

	They help each other make money, always looking out for their colleagues and friends and if you have any illness, disability or need, rich or poor, every single person will help you. We have lived in a pampered nation which seems to have taken us away from the true meaning of community. You look at Sri Lanka in all it’s beauty and you see streets full of people smiling, chatting and laughing, working together to help themselves - despite the tough conditions in which they live. They work twelve hours a day for very little, yet they get on with life and work for their friends, family and community. They are a people that many should take for example and life seems to be much more simple than the serious nature in which the UK does. As a place to visit, Sri Lanka is truly inspirational and never would I have thought I would have such an eye-opening experience, in terms of what there is to see and do but mostly the people that live here. Asia is an awe-inspiring continent and a beautiful contrast to our own world that certainly lives behind a smoke-screen for most.

Gap Year in the United Kingdom

	The UK (Great Britain) is an appealing gap year destination for so many reasons, you will meet new people, get to experience a unique culture, learn about the history of the country and enjoy the world class arts and entertainment. We have put together a guide to taking a gap year in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - below you can read more information and get top tips to get you prepare. We have working holiday jobs, internships, study abroad programs or you could just explore the country on an overland tour. Also if you have ever dreamed about spending a gap year in London you can turn this into a reality today, we have jobs and internships available to join throughout the year. Start planning the most amazing adventure of your life.


	Why a gap year in your own backyard could be the alternative to a cliched &#39;GapYah!&#39;

	What do you think when you hear the term ‘Gap Year’? Travelling, backpacking, full-moon parties, dodgy stomachs? The chances are, you’re thinking a fresh-faced British teen in a far- flung land. That’s the generally-accepted perception – a chance for school leavers to visit a foreign country, let loose and drink to excess after breaking free from the restrictions of school life. I’m not for one minute writing to advocate against this. I enjoy visiting different countries and getting some sunshine as much as the next guy.

	Having said that, with the now notorious ‘gap yah’ viral video still rippling across British sixth forms and colleges, more and more people are growing cynical about travelling miles and miles abroad to ‘find themselves’. And the near daily headlines of graduates facing long-term unemployment, despite sending in hundreds of CVs with stellar academic achievements, suggest that young people can no longer afford these hedonistic and purposeless trips that amount to extended holidays.  

	For those who want to make a sustained change in a community, a trip to build a school on a gap year in Africa seems high in self-interest but low in genuine help for people living in need.  Speaking to friends who volunteered in Fiji, the questions were unanimous: ‘do we actually know if anyone wanted that?’ and ‘what was that for again?’ Yet, this enthusiasm to ‘make a difference’ is real and heartfelt. So the question is: in  2013, can you take a gap year where you really have an impact helping a community that need it, learn about a different culture, improve your employability and have some fun along the way without being a complete cliché?   

	The short answer is ‘yes’.  

	There are so many organisations encouraging young people to spend their gap year in the United Kingdom. Why at home? Because we face complex social issues that need the energy and creativity of smart young people. Search our gap year options for the UK and apply today.

Most London airports are connected to international airports around the world. If you live in Europe you are best catching a service like RyanAir, EasyJet or WizzAir.

There are lots of airports you can fly into and it really depends on what area of the country you would like to visit for which the best airport to fly into is. An alternative to flying is to either drive, join a tour or book a coach trip. If you live outside of Europe you are best booking flights in advance for the best deals. The summer period from May - September is usually most expensive time to visit so avoid this period if you are looking to travel on a budget.
	
		 
	
		Weather & Best Time to Visit
	
		The weather in the UK is notoriously wet and rainy. Try visiting during summer - May to August where you will get to hopefully see some sun. Visiting during Christmas and New Year is also a lot of fun, the country is lit up with festive street lights and decorations.

London and Edinburgh have some of the highest prices for the accommodation in the UK but generally the rest of the country is a lot cheaper. A hotel room will cost around £50 per night in the United Kingdom, this will be more around £100 in London. Hostel dorm beds are usually around £10 - £25 per night. If you are travelling with someone else it might be cheaper to get a hotel room rather than a private room in a hostel. If you are planning on staying more than a few days and are looking to travel on a shoestring you might want to consider a website like Couchsurfing. For long term stays you might want to consider houseshares which you can usually find through contacts, friends and websites like the Gumtree.
	
		 
	
		Transport & Getting Around
	
		There is an extensive rail and bus network meaning the whole country is very accessible. To get the best deals on rail fares you will need to book in advance as if you get tickets on the day it will be more expensive. Megabus offer cheap rail journeys in the UK if you travel Monday to Friday, you will need to book around 2-3 weeks in advance to get the cheapest fares. If you want to travel independently you could hire a car but please note petrol prices in the UK are very expensive. If you are looking to learn more about the country and would like to take some of the stress away you could join tours in the United Kingdom. The cheapest way to travel around the UK is via coach, there are several operators including National Express and Megabus. Throughout the year they have special offers on bus routes and you can travel for as little as £1. The journey time will be longer than taking the train but it will be a lot cheaper.
	
		 
	
		Food and Drink
	
		There is an international mix of food available in the UK so you will be sure to find something to match your tastes. To save money on food and drink whilst in the UK you can visit visit supermarkets for sandwiches and fresh food. It is a lot cheaper to make your own food as there are compatative prices on food with lots of chains available including Tesco, Sainsburys, Aldi, Liddle and Iceland. For eating out find the Wetherspoon chain of pubs which offers cheap pub food. Fast food outlets generally costs around £5 per meal, and the price of a pint of beer costs around £3.50 which can soon eat away at your budget.
	
		 
	
		
	
		Gap Year in London
	
		When you think of London, what do you think of? The Tower of London? Big Ben? Westminster Abbey? London is a lively and vibrant city that is filled with shops, historical sites and far more. While it can be pricey to visit the UK capital, it is possible to have a great holiday in London on a tight budget especially if you book flights in advance. Indeed, the more you can save on your flight, the more you have to spend on other things such as souvenirs. London is both the capital of England and the largest city you can visit on a gap year in the UK. This city is one of the most popular city destinations in the world, millions of people visit every year and this is also a popular stop off for gappers from countries like Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.
	
		Surprisingly enough, London is also very compact, making it easy to get around on foot and on the Underground network. There are eight million people living in London proper, although that number increases to 14 million when you factor in those commuting from the suburbs. It is one of the most recognised cities in the World and it has been a hub of culture, fashion, trade, finance and politics for centuries. London is full of things to see and enjoy. It is also considered a fairly safe city; nevertheless, a degree of common sense should be exercised when it comes to protecting yourself. Double-decker buses and the Underground make it easy to get around, and you will find many shopping centres intermingled with small store fronts that make you feel like you have stepped into a Charles Dickens novel. It is one of the cities in the World everyone must experience once in their lifetime.
	
		Getting around London is very easy, there is an extensive tube service and also buses, taxis and bikes available for hire. We recommend buying an Oyster card when you arrive into London, this is £5 and gives you discounted travel. You can also get the £5 back when you depart London. London is safe city to visit, stick to the main tourist trail and you should not have any problems. In an emergency dial 999 or for non urgent problems you can dial 111.
	
		 
	
		Getting from London Airports to the City Centre
	
		London airports include Heathrow, Gatwick, Stanstead and Luton. There are lots of ways to get from these airports to the city centre for all budgets. You can catch taxis which is the most expensive way and not always the quickest. Always remember to get the official rank, don&#39;t trust anyone who approaches you for a lift and usually you can get overcharged. 
	
		Stanstead airport is quite far from Central London it takes about an hour by train and longer by bus. You can buy a train ticket in advance for cheaper or also just turn up at the station which is a short walk from the departure lounge. There are also buses which are cheaper. 
	
		From Heathrow airport you can catch the tube which is our best recommendation, buy an Oyster card at the ticket office which will save you money on the public transport system in London. Heathrow is in zone 6 in South-West London and it will take about an hour to reach the centre of London.
	
		From Gatwick airport you can catch a train, either a public service or the Gatwick express which can get you to London in around 30 minutes. This is a very easy journey to complete.
	
		For Luton airport we recommend catching the Easybus or paying for the bus, Luton is outside of London but the route by motorway is very easy.

				Get a good pair of trainers, you&#39;ll do a lot of walking as the tourist sights are dotted all around the city
			
				If you are staying for a few days or more it is recommended to buy a tourist pass to save money on sightseeing, this will save you lots of money on major tourist attractions
			
				Head to St Johns Wood and get a picture at Abbey Road. There is also a good walk if you have a spare few hours through St johns Wood to Primrose hill, they views over London are impressive. From here you can either walk through Regents park or walk to Camden which is about 15 minute distance by foot
			
				Visit Camden where you will find alternative shops, a thriving market with cheap gifts, clothes and presents and there is also a great live music scene here
			
				If you are going shopping on Oxford Street and looking for a cheap place to eat or drink find the The Green Man pub just off Oxford Street near Soho
			
				Search out Samuel Smiths pubs for cheap drinks and a range of real ales in Central London
			
				Travelling around London by bus is cheaper than the tube and you will see a lot more
			
				If you like Indian food head to Brick Lane in East London, on Sunday there is also a popular market which is highly recommended to wonder around
			
				In summer head to some of the summer open outdoor swimming pools, Hampstead is recommended
			
				If you like Caribbean food go to &#39;The Bread Of Life Bakery&#39; on Coldharbour Lane in Camberwell (amazing food)
			
				A little way out of London down near Hastings you should try and visit Bodiam Castle absolutely breath takng
			
				For museums visit The British Museum / Natural History Museum and The Imperial War Museum.
			
				Go for &#39;Afternoon Tea&#39; at Beas of Bloomsbury near St Pauls Cathedral (another must see) amazing cupcakes.
			
				Shopping: Oxford St & Bond St (west end) , the Kings Road & Sloane St (chelsea).
			
				You should experience Portobello market and wander around Notting Hill to see colourful houses and one of the most sought after neighborhoods in London
			
				Head to Covent Garden street entertainment, a market and lots of bars and shops
			
				If you&#39;re in London at Christmas time you should go outdoor ice-skating at Somerset House or Natural History Museum
			
				Book a ride on the London Eye for views over the city, you could also go for a walk up Hampstead Heath or Primrose Hill for some more great views
			
				On Sunday you could visit Borough market for lunch followed by a walk down the Embankment
			
				Buckingham Palace & Westminster, Madame Tussueds and Ripleys Believe It Or Not Museum are worth visiting

Gap Year in Turkey

Gap Year in Ukraine

	Ukraine is an off the beaten track destination for any potential gapper but don&#39;t let this put you off, if anything you will get a more real and authentic experience whilst the best thing is the cost of travelling in this country. Ukraine offers great value, food, drink, hostels and accommodation are inexpensive compared to other destinations in Europe. Places you might want to add to your gap year must visit locations include Kiev which is the capital and where most flights arrive, the Carpathian mountains which are spectacular in natural beauty but just watch out for wild bears, the coastal city of Odessa or for beaches head to Popovka. If you looking for a different /adventure trip take a tour of Chornobyl!

Gap-Year Planning - Advice & Guidance
Gap-Year Planning - Advice & Guidance from Projects Abroad Staff... Planning your gap-year should be a huge task; if it isn’t, then you probably aren’t doing it correctly. But where on Earth do you start...?
Well don’t worry because the Projects Abroad staff are coming to your aid with this helpful Gap-Year Planning guide! We can’t promise you that it covers absolutely every eventuality, and it certainly won’t be able to book any flights for you, but it might just set you off on the right track.

Gap Year Planning: Working out your Itinerary

Budget
First thing’s first – you need to work out how much money you have available to spend. Whether you are going to be dipping into your savings, earning the money in the first half of your gap-year, or going cap-in-hand to your parents, you need to be realistic about how much you are going to have, because this will be vital in determining both how long you are going to be able to go away, and what your expected standard of living is going to be whilst you are away.

Destination
Once you know how much money you have, you are going to want to work out where you want to go. If you are reading this page then it is probably because you want to spend part of your gap-year volunteering on one of our projects, in which case you can click on the Projects section at the top of the page; that way you can choose a type of project and see where exactly we run this type of project. Alternatively you may already have a destination in mind, in which case you can click on the Destinations section; then you can find out the projects that are available there. We also have information on travel and tourism opportunities, both within the chosen destination and beyond.

Volunteering Costs
If you are planning on volunteering, it would be a good idea to sort this out first. You do not have to commit to anything at this early stage but working out in your own head what you want to do, where, and when will make the rest of the plans fit into place much more easily. A good place to start is to take a look at our Prices page, by clicking the link at the top of the screen. Remember that our prices include your accommodation, food and insurance for the time that you are volunteering.

Flights
Your flight costs are going to be another big expense and should therefore be worked out at the beginning. Again, you don’t have to commit any money at this stage (in fact we would ask you not to confirm flights relevant to your volunteering period until you have received full acceptance from us that we have a place for you) but getting an idea of how much you are going to be required to spend is going to help immensely. If you wish, Projects Abroad can sort out your flights for you; the advantage of this is that you let us do all that hard work (you can find out more by clicking on the Prices link at the top of the page and then selecting “Flight Prices” from the left-hand menu bar). Or you may be getting a “Round-the-World” ticket. Or you may be able to use collected “Air Miles” to reduce the cost of a ticket. There are many options and it can be a minefield, but take time to look around and you will reap the rewards!

Transportation
When you have planned out the air-travel, you are probably going to want to work out the overland travel possibilities. There is unlikely to be too many things that you can book in advance – perhaps only the odd lengthy train or boat journey – but what you want to work out is whether it is actually both possible and realistic to cover the distances between flights in the time you have set yourself. To do this it is advisable to get hold of a comprehensive, up-to-date travel guide.

A classic mistake is to plan so much travelling that you forget to schedule in time to actually see the places you are arriving in! On the other hand a skilful trick – which is particularly helpful for those people on a tight budget – is to schedule night buses and trains in for long journeys; this way you save money that you would have spent on accommodation. Please consider the safety of travelling by night in certain destinations and avoid travelling alone at night. If you do decide that you are going to book a ticket in advance, then do your best to ensure that the ticket is flexible; gap-year travelling can be unpredictable and you don’t want to change your plans but then find that you can’t change your ticket.

Visas
So you know where you want to go, when you want to go there and that this plan is achievable. Your only real remaining logistical barrier is getting your visas sorted out for your destination countries. If you are a British citizen you are very lucky, in that you can travel to a number of countries without getting a visa in advance. But there are still many countries where it is not so easy, and every country’s rules are different. Projects Abroad will be able to assist you in obtaining a visa for the destinations that you are volunteering in; this process takes place after you have been accepted. Please be aware that some countries will charge for a visa.

Accommodation
The last major part of your itinerary will be looking at where you are going to be staying, as this will be a major part of your daily costs. On a gap-year you are probably going to be looking at “budget” accommodation for the most part, and the basic hostel dorm-room is about as budget as you are going to get.

However there may be days in your itinerary when you want a little bit more comfort or security – say, for example, if you arrive in a new location late at night. In these circumstances it is often advisable to book in advance. Advance bookings can usually be made by phone or online. In fact, you may find – as the internet becomes increasingly accessible to people in the developing world – that you will book more and more of your accommodation online. Please remember that all your accommodation requirements are included for the duration of your Projects Abroad placement.

Gap Year Planning: Important Considerations

Travel Insurance
Even if you are on a very tight budget, do not consider leaving the country without travel insurance! There are all manner of different types of cover and it is important that you understand what they are offering; the best way to do that is to simply start looking! For the duration of your volunteering placement you will be covered by Projects Abroad’s own insurance, and we can extend this to fit your dates if you require us to. But if not, please ensure that you find a suitable policy - one which includes cover for any activities you are planning on doing, such as horse-riding, white-water rafting, etc.

Immunisations and Vaccinations
If you have never travelled out of Europe before, there are likely to be a number of jabs that you definitely should get, and a few more besides that would be highly recommended. Some of these may be given as part of a programme, over the course of a number of weeks. For this reason it is advisable that you get in touch with your GP as soon as possible. They will also be able to give you advice about protecting yourself against malaria, if you are going to be entering a malaria-risk zone.

Medication and Repeat Prescriptions
If you are taking any medication you will need to speak with your GP about obtaining enough to last you throughout the period you are away, as you may not always be able to get hold of exactly what you require overseas. The same applies to things like disposable contact lenses.

Staying in Contact
It is becoming increasingly easy to remain in close contact with friends and family whilst travelling, but you still need to put a little bit of thought into it – not all mobile phones will work in all countries for example, so you will probably want to check with your mobile network. One of things we actively encourage our volunteers to do when they arrive overseas is to purchase a local SIM card so they can contact other volunteers cheaply, but you should consider using your old SIM card when calling people back home, just make sure before you go that you know how much you will be paying to do so.

Many people also like to set up some sort of ‘blog’, so they can update people on what they are doing without having to write lots of individual emails. And always remember – people still love receiving postcards!

Make Photocopies
You don’t want to risk losing important information like your insurance details, Projects Abroad staff phone numbers, the phone number of the hotel that you will be staying at when you first arrive, etc. So make copies of everything, ideally one to leave with a trustworthy, easily contactable person back home, and one for you to carry around in a separate bag to the originals.

In many countries you will be expected to carry some form of identification at all times, and failure to produce at least a photocopy of both the main page of your passport (the page with the photograph of you on it) and your visa card/stamp when asked to by a police officer can lead to problems.
Gap-Year Planning: Packing

The old piece of advice concerning packing for travelling is that you should get together everything you think you are going to need, lay it out on the floor, and throw half of it away. Though probably not wise to follow this to the exact letter, it does demonstrate the point that you rarely need or use as much as you think you will.

Of course everybody is different and nobody can tell you exactly what you should and shouldn’t be taking. But most people find that the best recipe for success is “variety”; pack to cover lots of different eventualities, but make sure you don’t pack too many things which cover the same eventuality! For example, what is the point in taking 10 different T-shirts when you can take 3 and a bottle of travel detergent?

It is important to realise that many of the things that you are considering buying for your trip can be easily purchased – often at a much lower price – overseas. But there are a number of key items that you might want to consider, such as: a universal electrical plug adaptor, a universal sink plug (they do exist!), a ball of string (always useful for impromptu washing lines), a sewing kit and a sleeping bag liner or duvet cover (much lighter than a sleeping bag, but affords you protection from dirty mattresses). To help you tailor your packing to your chosen Projects Abroad destination, we will provide you with a kit-list once we have set you up with your personalised “My Projects Abroad” webpage.

Gap Year Safety – Advice & Guidance
With around 30% of our volunteers being either on their gap years or of gap-year age, gap-year safety is a subject we take very seriously. We have over 17 years of experience dealing with volunteers from this age-group and our overseas staff are thoroughly trained to be aware of the dangers posed to young volunteers. It is their responsibility to keep volunteers as safe and well-versed in these dangers as it is possible to be, for the duration of their time away with us and beyond.
It is natural that parents want to ensure that their son or daughters knows as much about the risks involved as possible before they leave home, which is why we have put together this handy resource – a bank of advice, hints, tips and guidance from the staff of Projects Abroad – for our Gap-Year travellers. We have all been in the same situation at some point (although for some of us that point feels like an awfully long time ago!) and have also seen successive years of Gap-Year travellers going away with us, so we hope this will be of some help.
Gap-Year Safety: Before you go

There are a vast number of gadgets and pieces of equipment that are geared towards traveller safety, but you cannot pack them all, and therefore it pays to take a little time to really think about what you are going to need.

    * A medical kit is always going to be at the top of your list; there are all manner of different ones available and you should look to purchase one which includes the type of equipment and medications which suit the areas that you are going to – for example if you are planning on travelling to more remote locations then you should ensure that your kit contains some sterile syringes.
    * Padlocks are another wise purchase. Smaller ones can be used to keep your rucksack secure; by threading them through the loops of your zips. Larger ones can come in handy when securing rooms in many shoestring budget hostels.
    * Money-belts should be considered as a means of keeping cash and important possessions safe and hidden away. They are usually worn around the waist, under clothes. It can be awkward withdrawing money from them so it may also be a good idea to keep a small amount of cash in a more accessible location, such as a small purse in a pocket.
    * Personal alarms should be considered by everyone, not simply lone females. When activated they simply draw attention by making an incredibly loud, piercing noise, which is bound to deter any would-be criminal.
    * It is always a good idea to have a torch handy; apart from the fact that you are likely to find yourself in poorly lit areas far more regularly, the electricity supply will probably be a lot less reliable in the locations you will be visiting. For our conservation projects a head-torch is a particularly good investment.
    * You will probably already have a mobile phone but it is a good idea to purchase a local SIM card when you get out to your destination country, as this reduces costs, both for yourself and for other volunteers calling you. For this reason we ask that all volunteers check with their mobile service provider that their phone has a roaming service available. Local staff will then be able to help you buy a SIM card during your induction.
    * Malaria is one of the biggest killers in a number of our destinations and protecting yourself from being bitten by mosquitoes is vitally important. While your doctor can advise you on the type of medication that you might want to be taking (prophylactic pills are available which can be taken on a daily basis), you should also consider a good quality spray. In addition to this, a mosquito net should be considered; even though most hostels in malaria zones will have their own nets, they are often old and of poor quality.
    * Whilst it is generally advisable to drink only bottled water, or at the very least water that you completely trust as having been thoroughly purified, you may find yourself in a situation where you do not have access to either, in which case it is a good idea to have water purification tablet with you. These may often be sold as part of your medical kit.
    * Protection from the sun is very important, as a number of our destinations can be very hot at certain times of the year, if not all times! A high protection factor sun-cream is the very least you should be arming yourself with; you should also consider taking some sort of hat to protect yourself from the effects of sun-stroke, which comes on quickly and can be very dangerous. After-Sun lotion or moisturiser will help sooth any burnt skin.

Gap-Year Safety: In Destination

The vast majority of crime suffered by foreign travellers is non-violent crime, such as pickpocketing. Potential criminals are unlikely to want to have face-to-face confrontations and for this reason they will tend to go for easy targets. Unfortunately, in most destinations you are going to stick out like a sore thumb, because you are a) young, and b) clearly not a local. For this reason it is important to take certain simple precautions.

    * Look like you know what you are doing. Okay so this isn’t the easiest thing to do in an environment which is completely alien to you, where you want to soak in as much as you possibly can, but one of the clearest giveaways is when people walk around whilst continually scrutinising a large fold-out map! Try to avoid this by working out a route before hand, drawing out or finding a smaller map, or simply checking your larger map in quieter, more discrete moments.
    * Do not show any signs of wealth. Expensive watches/jewellery/sunglasses; unsecured wallets or purses; MP3 players; large obtrusive cameras – these all draw attention to you and mark you out as a potential target for thieves. For this reason it is advisable to not bring very expensive items with you on your trip abroad, let alone have them on your person on a daily basis. You should ensure that any money and photographic equipment you carry with you is as discrete as possible.
    * Be careful of crowded areas. Pickpockets tend to strike in busy areas, where they can get what they want without being seen, even if their victims become aware of what is happening. For this reason a good precaution is to move your day-bag round to the front of you if you happen to find yourself in a crowded place, and make sure you keep an eye - or a hand – on possible places where people might try to gain access to your valuables. Also do not have your valuables readily accessible if you can possibly avoid it; at the bottom of your bag, underneath clothes and books is ideal. And obviously do not leave your bag unattended at any times.
    * Avoid being alone on the street at night-time. Places change when the sun goes down, and even your most well-trodden street can become unfamiliar and potentially dangerous. It is advisable to use public transport or private taxis (but only those recommended by local staff) and to make sure you are part of a group as much as possible. If you have to walk alone, stick to well-lit areas as much as possible and carry a personal alarm with you.
    * Look out for other volunteers and ask them to look out for you. We try to encourage our volunteers to work as a team as much as possible, ranging from keeping an eye on each other’s bags when using public transport during the week, to making sure that everybody is accounted for if you go travelling at the weekend. We particularly request that lone female volunteers are seen safely to their door by other volunteers, and are never the last person to be dropped off from a taxi ride home at the end of a night out.
    * Be wary of people’s motives. It is a great shame, but it is a fact of life that you simply cannot blindly trust strangers. You are likely to approached by a great many people while travelling abroad. Some of these people will be merely curious about you, your language and your culture. Some of them will want to try to sell you something. Others will be begging for money. And others still will have more sinister intentions, often involving extortion of money by some means or another. There are all manner of scams which people run, from short-changing tourists in shops (always be sure to check your change), and unwinnable games played by people out on the streets (often played with playing cards or balls in cups) to scams involving “precious” jewels and fake art exhibitions. In short – don’t act like a fool or you risk being fooled!

      (In the case of begging, it is not our place to moralise on the rights or wrongs of giving money to people who ask for it, but it is worth noting that not all beggars are as destitute as they appear to be, and giving money is only going to make you a greater target for beggars in the future, either from the person who you gave to, or others who witnessed the act. More important, perhaps, is the notion that you should not feel obliged to give money simply because somebody less well-off than yourself asks you to, and – if you really feel like you want to help them – giving them an item of food is probably a better way of helping in any case)

    * Always make sure somebody knows where you are. This is important on many levels; your parents back home will want to know where you are in a general sense – say the city you are in, or the area you are travelling to at the weekend – so be sure to let them know via email, telephone call or text. More locally you should let Projects Abroad staff know if you are planning on going away on a trip out of town and it is important to ensure your fellow volunteers are aware of your plans too. For this reason we strongly recommend buying a local SIM card or phone after you arrive.

This is by no means an exhaustive list, but hopefully it is enough just to get you thinking. Essentially the best advice we can give you is to use your own common sense and then everything should be fine. And remember that - despite the stories you may hear – the vast majority of gap-year travellers get through their time away without any trouble whatsoever. If you have any more questions or concerns however, then please contact one of our advisors on +44 (0)1903 708300.

Graduates facing a tough employment market choose the gap year route instead
It's the hectic time of year where students across the UK are preparing for their final exams, rushing through those last pieces of coursework and looking forward to a well-earned break from study. While the next step for most of those approaching the end of their degree would be to enter the world of work, an increasing number of graduates are choosing an altogether different path.
A recent study conducted by Studentgems.com, a leading employer and graduate matchmaking website, has found that 12% of graduates intend to take a gap year rather than take their chances in a difficult employment market. Though the economic downturn is on its way back up, there is still a long way to go, and with only 5% of job applications resulting in interviews, the freedom and adventure of gap year travel has a considerable appeal.

While taking a gap year is a great way to avoid the employment blues and take some time out, it can also offer the chance to gain useful life experience and develop new skills. In a tough employment market many graduates are looking for travel options that will not only offer a refreshing change from study, but also enhance their employment prospects.

Gap year companies such as Real Gap provide travellers with a range of exciting opportunities across over 35 different destinations around the globe. Explorers can combine adventure with worthwhile and career-boosting experiences such as volunteering, teaching abroad, and a number of certificated courses. Graduates also have the option to mix volunteering with cultural immersion on a variety of tours such as the Thailand Experience and the Kruger to Coast Volunteer Adventure.

For graduates who make up the 34% of those looking for work abroad, Real Gap also offer several paid work programmes, giving travellers the chance to test drive a new career or even start a new life abroad. Travellers with a longer haul journey in mind spend a year away with The Real Ultimate Aussie Package or the New Zealand Paid Work programme, or opt for the China Paid Teaching with TEFL option; a fantastic way to get a TEFL qualification and put newly learnt skills to the test with both 6 month and 12 month placements.

Speaking about the current situation for graduates, Marketing Manager Lauren Mackay was keen to emphasise the benefits of taking a gap year `gap year travel not only offers the opportunity to take a break from years of study, it's also a great way to get some life experience and to gain skills that can help graduates to stand out from the crowd when it comes to searching for a job.'

Students and graduates considering gap year travel can find out more about Real Gap's range of travel options at http://www.realgap.co.uk or call 01892 516164 to speak to one of the company's expert advisers.

Grown up Gap Years - you haven't missed the boat!
Bored of work and being in the same place? Feel like experiencing new and exciting cultures? Need a fresh challenge and grown up gap year options? If you answered yes to these questions then you’re probably considering a career break - and why not? It’s your opportunity to give something back, have fun and get the time out you deserve. Career breakers return from their travelling adventures feeling revived, with new skills and directions and ambitions fulfilled.
Because there is no “normal” length of time for a career break, BUNAC offers volunteer projects all over the world that start from as little as five weeks to as long as eight months. Our volunteering and teaching placements in Africa, South and Central America and Asia provide career breakers of all ages with life changing opportunities and the chance to make a real difference. Ongoing placements range from teaching children to raising HIV/AIDS awareness, from community development to environmental and conservation work. You can use this time to really step outside your comfort zone and learn new skills or use the valuable life experience you have already gained to make a change in the lives of those less fortunate.

Or if you feel like working in a completely new environment, BUNAC’s exclusive IEP visa enables under 35s to live, work and travel in New Zealand on a grown up gap year for an entire year. Whether you decide to continue on your career path or embark on an entirely new ski/surf/sheep farming quest in the adventure capital of the world is entirely up to you! While you may worry about potentially losing a place on the career ladder, it is worth noting that working abroad actually increases one’s employability as it shows adaptability, independence and cultural awareness. The skills and experience that you learn on a working holiday will be a real asset on your return and make a great talking point at interviews!

Aged 33 and having returned from an adventure-filled year with her travel buddy Sue in New Zealand, Jo spoke to us about her working holiday...

Su and I both needed the IEP Work Exchange Visa for our working holiday as we were over 30, but did our age mean our experiences were vastly different from the ‘typical’ Work New Zealander (if there is such a thing)? Yes probably, but I don’t think that is a negative thing.

We often found that our age opened up other avenues to us – I’m sure it played a part in us being invited into strangers' houses to stay and the holiday park deciding to give us a weekly rate.

People obviously undertake this type of adventure for many different reasons, whatever their age, and the main thing is that they have the adventure that they want and return home fulfilled.

The main piece of advice I would give to everybody is meet and interact with the locals and many more experiences will open up to you. And when you do meet other people, don’t just talk about your adventures, LISTEN!

Like the sound of this? You haven’t missed the boat (or flight)!

How to Avoid Scams when Applying to Volunteer Abroad

	Researching a volunteer programs around the world? Not looking to spend a fortune or get scammed by a un-reputable organisation? In recent years literally hundreds of new volunteer organisations have sprung up, most are legitimate but don&#39;t get caught out by some scams.


	There are lots of scams and things to watch out for when you are beginning the process of applying to volunteer to give service, this goes with both large international sending agencies and also grass roots non-profits / charities.

	Some international travel companies have been accused of ripping off applications and charging them fee&#39;s which are really high when if you apply direct to the local project there is only a small donation really needed. Whilst a lot of local organisations claim to have non-profit or charitable status and have positive testimonials on their websites which makes them look very appealing but in reality they are just out to con potential applications into paying for something.

	We just want to prepare you and help you not to get caught out. We have heard feedback from people who have booked, paid and turned up in country for their placement either no to exist or to be not as described. Some organisations offer special prices and cheap upfront fees but towards the end of the booking and also don&#39;t be fooled by some organisations have non-profit status, sometimes the owners will pocket the money at the expense of local staff.

	Recently in the media there has been quite a lot of press and coverage about how effective international volunteers are, and is participating doing more harm than good. You might want to read some of these articles before applying which generally have been focusing on orphanage volunteer programs in countries like Cambodia which has been booming, Westerns / foreigners pay a fee to help children when in reality the children shouldn&#39;t be there in the first place. Orphanage tourism is currently big business and it is alleged that some organisations have been taking children against their families will, or even paying their families to have the children put in a care home just so they can get money through donations and international volunteers.

	There are lots of ways to avoid being scammed though and this generally involves using common sense and research. On the internet there is a vast amount of information, from reviews to social media pages where you can read feedback and actually talk to previous volunteers. Please research all organisations before applying, there are lots of really rewarding opportunities but also some scams to watch out for. To avoid scams check to see if the organisations has a valid website/feedback or if they are listed on reputable resources like Idealist and One World 365.

	People are your best form of guidance, check feedback on websites like Facebook, Twitter, Linked-In, Trip Advisor and forums. Contact past participants to see how their experience went and if they would recommend the organisation.

	Please note most organisations will require you to pay a deposit to book a place but if an organisation starts asking for more money than initially stated or demanding extras fees this is usually a warning sign. But if something seems a bit suspicious or you have any reservations don&#39;t be afraid to ask questions.

	There are lots of reputable agencies offering reasonable prices and even lots of really worthwhile special local operations around the world, just check everything before signing up. If you have any questions about certain organisations feel free to contact us for independent advice.

How to Not Harm Animals When You Travel

	Charles Darwin once said, “The love of all living creatures is the most noble attribute of man”. Witnessing animals in their natural habitats is, perhaps, one of the most fulfilling experiences a person can have whilst abroad. 


	Southeast Asia boasts some of the most exotic and diverse wildlife on the planet. From pygmy elephants to orangutans, there are many exciting species to see which we would never have the opportunity to see at home. However, has our love of exotic animals contributed to the destruction of the sub-continent&#39;s most majestic species?

	With the rise of western mobility has come a significant rise in the profitability of animal tourism, where in today’s world one can play with a tiger for less than the cost of a Starbucks coffee. Darwin was right: we do love animals, and many of us resent the idea of any animal being harmed for human enjoyment. Yet, when we travel, we may unknowingly contribute to the suffering of animals on a monumental scale. Continuingly, with the rise of animal tourism, comes a rise in unnecessary accidents and human fatalities  such as the sad case of a British national in Thailand last year, emphasising the volatile nature of the wild. 

	Ultimately, this article will highlight how we as tourists may be contributing to unethical practises and look at tips on how to avoid this.

	 

	1. Think Before You Book 

	

	You have probably seen images on social media of people riding on the back of elephants, or perhaps cuddling a tiger cub. However, it is important to think before you book. Is what is offered at this particular attraction natural? If you are paying to ride on or pet a usually wild and dangerous animal, watch it walk a tight-rope, or perhaps dunk a basketball, then these animals have likely undergone a process of domestication. You may have seen videos circulated of what is known as &#39;elephant crushing’.

	This kind of process teaches unnatural behaviour to elephants by confining them to tight spaces, or beating them until they willingly submit to its handler’s will. Unfortunately, this process is not unique to elephants. Many other mammals are known to undergo similar treatments such as drugging or the removing of teeth. While these animals have been through a process of domestication, they are still wild and arbitrary mammals which have the potential to act unpredictably and viciously by their very nature.

	With this in mind, consider whether what you are booking is a natural and authentic experience, or whether the animal may have undergone some kind of unpleasant or violent coercion. You should also consider whether you as a young traveller are prepared; before booking any wildlife attraction you must make sure you have adequate travel insurance and the correct vaccinations!

	 

	2. Think Before You Eat

	Another way we contribute to the suffering of animals while travelling Southeast Asia is by what we eat. Tourists are eager to try out local delicacies, ready to participate in what they believe to be a part of local culture; however, you may be unaware that what is being offered could be a rare or endangered species. Furthermore, according to the Soi Dog Foundation, tourists who participate in the eating of dogs are ignorant of the fact that they are often clubbed to death or boiled alive before reaching their plates. So, be sure to think before you eat: are you aware what you are eating or how it has been reared?

	This is an excellent opportunity to try some of the delicious local vegetarian or vegan options Southeast Asia has to offer. While the sound of not eating meat on holiday is an unattractive prospect for most people, vegetables are often the staple food for the local population in Southeast Asian countries, making it a perfect way to immerse yourself in the local culture. It is also important to mention that this is a great way to avoid any stomach bugs while you’re away as it diminishes the chances of becoming ill through eating poorly sourced or cooked meat! Do make sure that you have had a look at the health-specific pages on the FCO’s website for the country you are travelling to, so that you know what to do if you do fall ill.

	 

	3. The Blame Game

	Pointing the finger of blame at certain groups or individuals is counterproductive to achieving sustainable tourism. Instead of blaming ourselves or the people whose travel pictures we see on social media, we must learn from our own mistakes. I, myself, having ridden an elephant while in Laos, who – after being coerced by mahouts to begrudgingly allow me and one other to ride him during peak heat season – angrily stampeded along a shallow river with me on his back.

	As humans, it is not safe to ride or play with naturally unpredictable animals. My unsafe experience led me to question my assumptions about animal tourism, wishing that I had researched more about this issue beforehand. Contrastingly, it is of no use to blame locals for this exploitation. We, as tourists, have created a demand for these kinds of experiences, and, in emerging or rural economies, the tourist industry has become a main source of revenue for entire communities, who depend on this for financial stability. The only path forward is through education regarding responsible animal tourism.

	 

	4. Responsible Animal Tourism

	

	Thanks to the work of animal welfare foundations, ethical tourism is becoming increasingly easier to take part in. Foundations such as World Animal Protection and Wildlife Friends Foundation support ethical wildlife attractions in Southeast Asia. For example, Boon Lott&#39;s Elephant Sanctuary, the Kindred Spirit Elephant Sanctuary and Elephant Nature Park in Thailand do not condition their animals to perform, and are places where visitors can participate in an authentic and safe wildlife experience abroad. Please visit their websites for more information on ethical animal attractions in Southeast Asia and how you can personally help combat the destruction of Southeast Asia’s wildlife.  

	 

	By being prepared before your travel, you will be in the best position to experience all the finer things that Southeast Asia has to offer. For the latest foreign travel information, head to the FCO&#39;s Travel Advice website. You can also follow the FCO on Twitter, watch their videos on YouTube and add them on Facebook to get instant access on all of the latest travel updates.

How Working at Summer Camp Will Change Your Life

	So, you&#39;re thinking of working on a Summer Camp? Go for it, I won&#39;t stop you! But, before you start throwing deposits and references all over the place, take the time to read from the experience of a soon-to-be 5th Year International Councelor; You&#39;re about to make a terrible decision (hear me out...)


	Why? I mean, how bad could it be? You&#39;ll get paid to spend two months living for free and having fun on a camp, two months building unbreakable friendships and of course; 2 months of building that perfect tan! What&#39;s not to like? Well, nothing, which is exactly the problem. 

	 

	Meet The Real You

	If you choose to go to camp, you will absolutely have the time of your life, but you&#39;ll come back changed; Your career will have become a job, your home will have become a house and your all important five year a plan will probably have been thrown under a bus. Your world will suddenly feel small and slow, you&#39;ll feel lost for a short time, as if your entire being has just become confused with its direction, but all this is ok... in fact, its better than ok, its amazing; because, through camp, you will have just met the most incredible and important person in the World; you&#39;ve just met &#39;The Real You&#39;.

	This may not make a lot of sense, surly you&#39;ve always been &#39;you&#39;, right? In a way, yes, but you have different versions of yourself depending on the situation right? At home you are &#39;Version I&#39;, at work you are &#39;Version II&#39;, with friends you are &#39;Version III&#39;, get the idea? Well, at camp, you are the original, mint condition, collector&#39;s edition of yourself. You may not even realise that you&#39;ve changed, but once you&#39;re home, others will notice a difference; after a Summer of running activities, looking after kids, planning events and leading projects, you will have gained &#39;the unmeasurables&#39;, a set of qualities that subtly tell anyone you meet that you are totally in command of yourself and everything you set your mind to.

	 

	How I Got Started

	The process may be daunting, but nothing worthwhile is easy. Take my case and you&#39;ll have no excuse; In 2013, I was 20 years old and had never left the UK, never been on a plane and never been on a trip lasting over 2 weeks. After searching the web for a way to travel, I stumbled on Summer Camps; something grabbed my attention and I followed the process, I completed the application, I found the flights and did everything right up to the point where I had to commit money. That’s where I faltered. It took me about a month to decide to pay the deposit, then it was real, I was going abroad! I never truly thought it would happen, doubting every step of the way;

	I&#39;ll never get accepted, surly;
	I did.

	I&#39;ll never get placed, no way!
	I did.

	I&#39;ll never get a contract, not a chance;
	I did.

	Time and time again I was proven wrong, after the interviews, applications, forms and payments, I was suddenly in the airport with a giant bag and a pile of papers that felt far too important to be in my possession. I had nerves that would have made Cowardly Lion blush, I had absolutely no idea what I was doing, but, I was doing it, and it felt incredible.

	 

	Arrival at Camp

	

	Once arriving on the other side, everything was a blur, from terminal to cabin, thrust into a small space in the middle of nowhere with a bunch of total strangers, but everyone hit it off immediately, there was so much common ground from the outset simply as we had all been through exactly the same process to make it this far. We spent the first night getting unpacked into the cabins while introducing ourselves and getting to know each other. Then there were the returners, I&#39;d never encountered such a strange collection of people, in fact they were beyond strange, running around, singing songs, laughing at antics and events from previous Summers and generally acting as if they were drunk, in a way they were, drunk on camp (Little did I know that I would be acting much the same following Summer).

	 

	Role as a Camp Counselor

	

	Fast forward again, half way through the Summer, things are going great, at first I was overwhelmed by the tsunami of children charging up the hill to the cabins, I had to learn half a hundred names, run activities, organise events and govern a cabin full of 10 year olds, it was all I could do to keep my head screwed on the right way, all around seemed like total chaos. I can&#39;t tell you of the moment I figured it all out, I just did, it just clicked. One moment I was in orientation half panicking about how awful I was going to be, the next, I was a councelor in week three of camp.

	Half the battle in this place in your head, conquer the anxiety and the worry, and you&#39;ll have it.

	You&#39;ll start getting &#39;your firsts&#39; in week two, the first time you&#39;re asked to tie a shoe lace, the first time they make a drawing for you, the first time they trust you with their favourite toy or their lucky hat. To you, it may be nothing, but to them, its everything, it shows that they are comfortable with you, that they trust you, that they look up to you and want to be more like you. This is when the change happens, you realise that you&#39;re no longer here for the cheap living and easy travelling, you&#39;re here for them. Even though they may wake you up at the crack of dawn and keep you up till midnight, they may throw food or get into fights on the sports field. Whatever they do, however they feel, you&#39;ll be there to guide, help or show them through it.

	 

	What You Will Learn

	

	By the time Summer comes to an all too sudden end, you&#39;ll have made a vast network of new friends and contacts, most of which you feel more comfortable around than many people from your original social circles, whenever you see these people again (and you will), you will immediately convert into one of those strange &#39;post-camp&#39; people that seem to exist purely to laugh and talk about camp.

	But also, you&#39;ll have taught someone to swim and someone else to be a good sportsman, you&#39;ll have shown a camper how to write a letter to their parents and taught them how to clean up after themselves, how to treat each other fairly. In a world away from their parents and families, you&#39;ll have given them the foundation of becoming truly independent. It goes without saying that their parents are irreplaceable of course, but in just a few short weeks you&#39;ll be humbled by just how close you came.

	 

	Positive Effects

	You&#39;ll come away from camp having changed lives, truly. But you&#39;ll also note how those same, sometimes annoying and often hilarious campers have also changed you.

	At the start of this article I stated that camp would turn your world upside down, change your priorities and generally be a bad idea for your long term plans; well, take it from me as I start the process for Year Five, you will never, ever, regret a bad decision less than the one you&#39;re about to make.

	Now take a deep breath, dive in and get ready to meet The Real You.

How WWOOFing Changed My Life

	WWOOF, or World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms, is a worldwide organization that hooks farmers up with travelers. Travelers work on the farm for four to six hours a day in exchange for room and board. 


	WWOOF offers travelers a great way to travel on a budget, get to know the locals, and spend time in rural areas, while hosts get a little help and the chance to share their knowledge and perhaps plant the seeds of a lifelong passion - which is exactly what happened in my case.  

	 

	My introduction to WWOOFing started at a biology research camp in the Rockies. Here I worked with a German woman who had recently finished up a WWOOF stay.  She didn’t seem to have the best things to say, but perhaps it was because she was a vegetarian on a beef ranch.  Regardless, the idea intrigued me. I was about to graduate from university, and despite a lack of cash, was itching to go abroad. 

	 

	My first WWOOF experiences were in Australia, and while they were among the highlights of my trip, I can’t exactly call them life-changing. They did, however, eventually lead me to WWOOFing in Nepal, which is where the real magic happened.  

	I Saw what Sustainable Living Actually Looks Like 

	My first month was spent on a farming co-op in the Terai region of Nepal.  While I was quick to realize that my labor wasn&#39;t particularly needed, I was amazed by what I saw. 

	At the helm of the co-op was Chandra Adhikari. He was working diligently to incorporate permaculture principles and other creative techniques with traditional farming methods.  He had set up lights to attract flies to the pond at night to feed his fish - fish that would be released into the rice paddies in summer to fertilize and eat unwanted critters. He dabbled in farming frogs, worked at making more fuel-efficient stoves, and had built a methane digester to turn human and buffalo waste into cooking fuel. All the waste was then sent to the worms, who had to be kept on an island with a moat and a wall to keep the mongooses from eating them all.  

	Then it was onto farm number two. Surya, or Buwa (father), was equally passionate about his permaculture practice. This time, the farm was on the terraced foothills of the Himalayas.  Buwa grew coffee as a cash crop but also incorporated something like 80 useable plants into his coffee grove. Neem, cinnamon, papayas, and pineapple were just a few of the plants growing there. Other villages brought him their own coffee and Buwa dried and husked them before sending them off to be roasted. 

	 

	I Realized there was Problem

	On my first farm, Chandra and I took a visit to a nearby agricultural university, where a professor talked about the potential of agrotourism, and how it would be Nepal’s best chance against big agri-business. He shared some of the ways Nepalis had been fusing modern and traditional methods to make some ingenious innovations. Improved efficiency and the potential income from agri-business would be enough to unite Nepal against some of the devastating effects or corporate farming in India.  

	 

	On Surya’s farm, I learned a little more. A small English library introduced me to Vandana Shiva’s Stolen Harvest, and I was stunned by the devastating environmental effects of commercial shrimp farming in mangrove swamps, and mass suicides as farmers fell deeper and deeper into debt after switching to GMO crops. Say what you will about GMOs, but it was clear that the economies of the developing countries Shivw wrote about were not ready for them.  

	I Found the Key to Happiness (or at Least One of Them)

	Food!  After a while, I was starting to feel keenly aware of what I was eating. Very little food came from off either of the farms. Perhaps only the tea and sugar (though most sugar needs were provided by the bees). I was eating completely local food, hand processed, painstakingly cooked on clay stoves, and eaten with the hands.  Nowhere was there a break in the connection between the land and the food I put in my mouth.  It felt amazing!  I stopped craving sweets and junk food, and I started feeling the strangest urges to head into the coffee grove to meditate.  

	 

	 

	I grew up wandering around in the woods and had started a career in Fish & Wildlife. I was no stranger to the idea that being connected to nature was important to my happiness, but this took it to a whole new level.

	I Chose my Battleground and Started Planning

	Most travel addicts return from a trip and start dreaming about their next trip, but I couldn’t wait to get home to Canada and get started. While I was feeling deeply connected to the land in Nepal, there was something missing - it wasn’t my home.  

	 

	Back in Canada, I got to work. I joined WWOOF Canada, and on my days off of field work in Northern BC, headed south to the tiny town of Hazelton to work with a couple who were already living the off-the-grid dream. From them, I learned about compost powered hot water systems, passive solar heating, recycled veggie oil generators, and a whole slew of projects they had done or were planning on doing. They had spent years gleaning whatever knowledge they could from whoever they could and had made a great success of their projects and their lives.  

	I Found My Inner Educator

	Then there was a small issue of finding land and getting the time for my own projects.  I was working seasonally at the time as a backcountry park ranger in a remote location and as the fisheries technician. While my work allowed me to save money quickly, it also occupied the entire growing season. 

	 

	The issue was that while I loved the work, I never found it particularly fulfilling. It was a job I did for me, not for the rest of the world. Teaching came up not because of summers off, but because I wanted to share my new-found passion. I had worked a bit in outdoor education before, so I knew I liked at least some aspects of it.  In fact, I loved seeing the effects getting connected to nature had on kids. Unfortunately, I also knew that I found the classroom environment stifling.  Regardless I started working on my Bachelor of Education, deciding that I would work my way into teaching an outdoor program.  

	 

	Eight years later, I’m still working on buying the property, and I’ve sifted from outdoor education to special education. Despite outward appearance, the effect WWOOF had on my life shows up in my life every day. It forced me to change my perspective on how I was living my life and made me want to make a difference. It changed my career, influenced where I chose to settle down and continues to affect how I eat and behave as a consumer.  I may not have my bit of land yet, but I’m still growing a bit of food.

	Interview with a Projects Abroad Law Intern in China 

	Law is a notoriously competitive industry to break into. A Projects Abroad Law placement offers the chance to gain some work experience in the field. Zaineb Siddiqi graduated from The University of Law in Moorgate and she recently participated on one of our Law placements in Shanghai. She explains in an interview with Richard Egan, the Communications Officer in China, what she has been up to and what her experience has been like so far!

	Why did you decide to become a law intern in China?

	I have done some previous work experience placements at law firms in the UK, but I wanted some international legal training. Most law firms in London are looking for people who have knowledge of law from different countries so a part of the reason for the trip was to prove to my future employers that I have a keen interest in international law and that I am willing to go overseas to prove that. I wanted to specifically obtain first-hand knowledge of Chinese law, because lots of firms in London have Chinese clients. It will really help me in the future if I have an understanding of Chinese law and culture.  Also, I specifically wanted to go to Shanghai because many law firms in London have partners in Shanghai.  Another reason is that an occupation as a solicitor is such a competitive market so I need all the experience I can get.  I had a long look on the internet and saw the law internships that Projects Abroad offered and now here I am! 

	You’re working at the Tuo Ying Law Offices? Which area of law do they focus on?

	The main focus is on intellectual property law in China. The company have some international clients, the biggest being Samsung, but as of yet the firm is just based in Shanghai and they have no international partners. However, Tuo Ying Law Offices are currently in the process of attempting to expand and go international. During my time at the firm the company have had meetings with representatives from firms in Malaysia and the UK about potentially agreeing on a partnership in the near future. It is great opportunity as the meetings are in English so I can attend.

	During your project did you feel as though you are an asset to the team?

	Yes, I definitely think so! The partners here are always asking me questions about law procedures in the UK and are interested in my response. For example they have asked me to prepare an hour presentation about the ‘Protection of Intellectual Property in UK and the EU’ which the whole office will attend. It feels really good to help out like this and I feel as though my time here can be a learning experience for them as well as me.

	Other than attending meetings and preparing for a presentation, what other tasks do you carry out while working at the firm?

	My main duty at the firm is to shadow the lawyers. I usually shadow the main partner and he always translates everything that he is doing and he seems very eager for me to learn as much about Chinese law as possible. I also proof read English documents and write response emails. The majority of my day is spent researching Chinese law and asking my colleagues any questions I may have. As I said, the lawyers are never hesitant about asking me questions either!

	From your previous experience working at firms in the UK, is there a difference between the office atmosphere in Shanghai compared with the UK? 

	Yes, I think in the UK it is strictly ‘business’ and everyone is only focused on getting the job done, where as in China there is a really friendly atmosphere and everyone is very hospitable and accommodating. Every day at lunch the whole office goes to eat together and which makes the atmosphere relaxed and enjoyable. 

	From your experience it seems as though you have a really good relationship with your colleagues?

	Before coming I expected my interaction with the senior partners to be very limited, but we interact with each other the whole day! I am very pleased about this. 

	How useful do you think this experience is for your future?

	I know that this experience will be great for my future because I have proved that I have used my initiative and probably most importantly that I can adapt to different surroundings. Working with international law is something that I really want to do in the future so I think that this has been a great step towards reaching this goal! Also, of course having work experience in China will look great on my C.V!

	Outside of work how are you finding life in China?

	I’m really enjoying it! I live in an apartment in a very central area of Shanghai with other Projects Abroad volunteers. Although we are from different backgrounds and countries we all get on really well and most nights we head out for dinner together. We also arrange weekend trips so, although I came to China alone, I quickly made lots of friends. 

	Finally, what advice would you give to someone who is considering to intern at a law company in China?

	Go for it! This is an experience I will never forget and I have learnt so much! One thing I would suggest though is to try and learn a bit of Mandarin before coming as it helps when communicating with the staff and local people.

London: the perfect city to learn languages
Learning languages is good for your soul. Everyone who learns languages feels they are doing something fulfilling, something that will help them develop as human beings, individually and as a group. It may have to do with the feeling that there’s more beyond our limits. In fact, when you learn a language you also learn about a different culture, with different people, values, ideas, etc. While taking Chinese courses London students explain that there’s something bringing you together with the ‘different’, something that makes you feel identified with them. That might be the reason why language students tend to be more tolerant and understanding.
There are places that are considered to be “better” for language learning, and London is one of them. The population of London is made up of a wide range of different ethnicities, religions and cultures. Three hundred different languages are spoken in London, and it is visited every year by millions of people from around the world. London is a world-class international city, offering different things to the traveler, events and attractions that will inspire the imagination. 

According to the Office for National Statistics, 45% of Britain’s non-white population lived in London in 2001. London’s seven million residents follow 14 faiths and speak three hundred languages. In fact, to celebrate London’s diversity, events like the anti-racist music festival Respect are organized in the city.

With numbers like there, we can only think see London as a perfect city for language learning, cultural exchange and diversity promotion. If everyone with whom you interact happens to be interested in the rest of the world, imagine how much you can learn just by being surrounded by them. Whether you are taking Spanish, Chinese, German or Russian lessons London is sure to be the place where your new skill will be boosted. In general, when you start walking the path of language learning, you are not satisfied with only one language. You will want to explore more cultures, as you discover more and more differences and similarities with that of yours. Finding a suitable atmosphere that will trigger these exploring desires is crucial towards self-development.

Marathon du Medoc - A Challenge Not to Be Missed

	The Marathon du Medoc takes place in the Medoc wine region near Bordeaux. This lovely area of France in the south-west holds one of the top marathons in the world. This marathon is often on the bucket list of runners and for Janice Chung, it was an opportunity to combine her love of France with a passion for running. Here she shares her experience of what you can expect if you would like to compete in the future…


	Oysters. Beef. Cheese. Ice cream. Granola Bars. Cookies. Chips. Wine. Lots of wine. I ran the Marathon du Medoc in 2013 and this nourishment would get me through the 42.2 kilometers. It would not be one of my fastest races, but I didn’t really care. All I cared about was finishing…..sober.

	I arrived in Bordeaux two nights before the big race. This gave me a chance to barely get used to the time change. After all, the race was scheduled for 9 am, which was 3 am Toronto time. The day before the race, I hopped on a bus for a two hour ride to Pauillac to pick up my race kit. When I arrived, it was as if the party had already started. There were booths selling pate, wine, breads, sausages and other delicious foods. But the best was the deal of a glass of white wine and 6 oysters for 7 Euros, which is the equivalent of about $10 Canadian. Why not indulge the day before the race? I’d be burning over 2500 calories, so what did I care!

	I had to get up early to catch the 2 hour bus ride back to Pauillac and when I arrived, I thought I had entered a carnival with the Cirque du Soleil headlining. Suspended by an incredibly large inflatable balloon was a trapeze artist who was doing flips in the air. The balloon was transparent and tethered to the ground. Techno music was blaring out of many speakers and there was definitely a party mood.

	The day was overcast and chilly but this didn’t matter for the 8000 runners, many who were dressed up in costumes. Every year there is a theme and this particular year celebrated “Science Fiction”.  Thousands of runners were dressed up, some with tutus and some in superhero costumes.  There was even a gentleman in flippers with a snorkel and an inflatable dingy around his waist. I do not know how he could run a marathon in flippers! Being somewhat more reserved, I did not dress up.

	Once the gun went off, it was not necessarily a race to the finish, but rather a race to the first water station. But this was not a typical water station with cups of water. Instead there were hundreds of cups of wine laid out on the table for the runners to pick up and taste or gulp down. Plates of chips, crackers, raisins, cut oranges, and sugar cubes were also available. It was like a feeding and drinking frenzy. I was able to hit 18 of the 23 stations during the marathon. Some stations were too crowded. There wasn’t really pushing to get a glass of wine. We were just eager to drink and run on our merry way.

	My strategy was to take a few sips of wine at every station, and also accompany the wine with some water and food. I did not want to get drunk or pass out. While my intention was not to get a personal best time, I certainly wanted to finish the race….standing up with a smile on my face.  The lucky soul who finished first, however, got his or her body weight in wine.

	The Marathon du Medoc is not just a race down a road but rather a race that winds through some of the most famous vineyards in the world such as Chateau Mouton-Rothschild and Chateau Lynch-Bages. The grounds are open for runners to pass by the magnificent architecture and estates that have been around since the 1700s. The first marathon was created in 1984 by five Bordeaux runners, four of them doctors, who wanted to celebrate “pleasure, not pain” (as quoted in Forbes magazine).

	The atmosphere throughout the entire race was fun and supportive. A number of times it must have looked like I was slowing down, because there was always a helping hand behind my elbow, encouraging me onwards or the crowd cheering  “Allez! Allez!” (Go! Go!).

	Near the end of the race, I just had to stop for some freshly shucked oysters. After gulping a couple down with some wine, of course, I saw eight runners dressed as “The Flash”---in bright red costumes. I cautiously approached them and asked them if I could have my picture taken with them. Not only did they agree, but they also decided to lift me up in the air!  That certainly gave me a final burst of energy so that I could dash to the finish line, pausing briefly, of course to pick up an ice cream bar. It was the most delicious ice cream I had ever had. I even momentarily thought about turning around and getting another one, however, the end was near.

	Crossing the finish line wasn’t the only thrill for me that day. What a treat it was to be handed a finisher’s medal, a bottle of wine in a special wooden box, a commemorative knapsack and a wine cup on a rope! I needed that cup because there was more wine to come in the wine and beer tent!

	The people are happy and friendly; the climate is perfect, not too cold, not too hot; it’s a multicultural country, with 63 indigenous languages; its cultural, natural and historical heritage is classified among the sites of UNESCO; and the food is delicious.

	Mexico City is expensive, but you can find really nice places to stay, eat, and travel that are very cheap. View our guide and top tips how to visit Mexico City on a budget.

	 

	How to Get to Mexico City

	

	There are daily flights from numerous international destinations direct to Mexico City.

	Airlines which fly direct to  Mexico City from the United Kingdom include: Juarez International

		KLM, Air Canada, Air Europa, Air France, Alitalia, American Airlines, Avianca, China Southern, Delta, Iberia, LATAM, Lufthansa, Virgin Atlantic, Hainan Airlines and WestJet.

	Safety

	

	Mexico City does have a reputation but most international tourists have no issues as long as are careful. Be sure to buy travel insurance in advance, we recommend World Nomads.

	 

	Cheap Places to Stay in Mexico City

	There are very nice hotels and hostels all around the city. We suggest staying near the historical center which is a good base to move around the city. The following hostels are very cheap and recommended:
	 

	1. Downtown Beds

	Downtown Beds is a hostel in the heart of the Historical Center and it is the best alternative if you are staying a few days or even a long term. It is from the chain of Grupo Habitat Hotels (one of the best alternative 5 star hotels in Mexico). The price for a bed per night in an eight people bedroom with a shared bathroom goes from 200 MXN (14 US Dollars/12 Euros) to 550 MXN for a private room. It also has a dinning room, pool, terrace, laundry and a bar.

	To compare prices, see reviews and book, visit: Booking.com | Hostel World

	 

	2. Hostel Regina

	Hostel Regina is also in the Historical Center, a bit far away from the Cathedral, but it is still a good place. It has 100 beds, each bed per night is 190 MNX, and there are also private bedrooms. The good thing about this place is that all the prices are breakfast included. It has a kitchen, a TV room, Wifi and Internet, laundry and a bar.

	To compare prices, see reviews and book, visit: Booking.com 

	 

	Getting Around Mexico City

	

	Mexico City is secure in general, but you have to be careful like in any big city in the world. The best way to get anywhere is in the subway or Metrobus (a bus that has many lines). The price for a one-way ticket for either of these services is 6 MXP (33 cents of US Dollars/35 cents of Euro). 

	We strongly suggest not taking taxis from the streets, as they are not very safe. There are some “taxis de sitio” which means they belong to a business site and are safe taxis; they might me more expensive, but you will get to your destination with no problems. Ask in the desk of your hostel/hotel, they will have a couple of phone numbers of these sites and they can call for you.

	 

	Best Things to See & Do in Mexico City 

	If you want to see all the main sights of the city center then I recommend walking to be the best way of getting around because you’ll find some nice and unexpected places along the way. Check out some essential places you must visit in Mexico City below...

	 

	Historical Center

	

	
		Cathedral: It was built in sections from 1573 to 1813.
	
		Templo mayor: It was the center dedicated to make religious ceremonies in the time of the Aztecs. There are guided tours.  It is to the right of the Cathedral.
	
		Palacio Nacional: They give guided tours, so make sure you make a reservation. In 1522 it was the residence of Hernan Cortes. Later on it was the home for several presidents. Nowadays, it houses various government offices. It also has some Murals by the famous Mexican artist Diego Rivera.
	
		Madero Street: It is a street where the cars are not allowed to go through. It is a very crowded and beautiful street with shops, food courts and have some small stores which sell fresh fruit, in case you want a snack.  
	
		Torre Latinoamericana: It was the highest building built between 1933 and 1960 (today it is the sixth highest) and the only skyscraper built in a seismic zone. It has a 360° observation point and a restaurant on the top of the tower. The view is impressive. They say it seems like Mexico City has no end.
	
		Palacio de Bellas Artes: Built by President Porfirio Diaz at the beginning of the twentieth century, the inauguration was in 1934. It is a magnificent building not only outside, but also inside. They give tours and an explanation of the building, and if you’re lucky you can go inside and see the amazing glass curtain on the stage made out of Tiffany glass. You can also buy tickets to see the different regional dances of each state, called Ballet Folklorico de México. It is really worth seeing this majestic monument and the performance (which even the men like).
	
		Post Office Palace (Palacio Postal): Known as “Correos de México”. It was built in early XIX. It was the first building where you could send letters. The building inside is one of my favorites; you can imagine the people in that time and how they sent letters to their families. The building still serves as a postal service office.


	 

	Reforma/Polanco

	

	
		Angel de la Independencia: It is on Reforma Street. Nowadays, it is the symbol of National Independence and the place where any soccer championship is celebrated or any national rallies.
	
		Museo de Antrolopología: It is the best museum in Mexico City. In it you can explore the pre-Hispanic history of the Mayans of Yucatan, the Aztecs of central Mexico, the Zapotecas of Oaxaca etc., seeing their monuments of stone and murals and get an idea of what Mexico city has become over the years. It is a must!
	
		Voladores de Papantla: After visiting the emblematic Museo de Antropologia, ask for the show of the Papantla Flyers, (in the garden outside, by the entrance to the Museum) which is something extraordinary and impressive. Papantla is a town in the State of Veracruz, home of the Totonaco Indians. You will see something unique. It is a religious ceremony to make a tribute to fertility. It is a dance with five men: they climb up a 37 meters (90 feet) pole. At the top, on a very small platform one starts playing a drum and a flute and dances. The other four tie their ankles with a rope and they throw themselves into the sky, extending their arms as if they were birds flying.  They give 13 turns in the air multiplied by 4, signifies 52, which mean the years of one century that lasted in the pre-Hispanic calendar.
	
		Mercado de Artesanías: This is a craft market located in the neighborhood of La Zona Rosa. All the products are 100% Mexican. The prices are good and fair, the sellers might want to make you a discount, but I suggest you buy it for the price, as most of the income they get from the market is their only one, and besides you won’t find anything like that anywhere else on earth!
	
		Castillo de Chapultepec: It is the only castle in Mexico and was the home of Emperor Maximiliano I Hapsburg and his wife Carlota, who ruled during the 1860’s, supported by the invading French army. Nowadays, it is the National Museum of History.
		 


	South

	

	
		Xochimilco: It is a very long canal with “trajineras” (which are a type of big canoas driven by a man) with playful and colorful decorations. They usually have names of women. People go with friends and families to enjoy a nice and quite place in Mexico city.
	
		UNAM: It is the first national public university in Mexico.
	
		Museo de Frida Kahlo: It is the house converted in museum of the famous painter, Frida Kahlo.
	
		Museo Sumaya: It is a modern building in the neighborhood of Polanco. Its collections are European paintings from XV to XVIII centuries.


	 

	Best Places to Eat in Mexico City 

	

	In Mexico City every corner has a stand of quesadillas and other street dishes, which are usually very cheap and delicious.  There are this little stores called Oxxo where you can find the best potatoes chips and other candies, breads and chocolates made in Mexico. The trendy and hipster neighborhoods are Condesa and Roma.

	There you will find many coffee shops, organic restaurants, Mexican and international food, bars, shops here are some places to check out:

	
		Azul Condesa/La Tecla: Mexican fusion food. Condesa neighborhood
	
		Puro Corazón/La Casa de las Sirenas: Mexican food. The first is cheap, the second might be a bit expensive but it is worth it.
	
		Beso huasteco: A very beautiful old house made a Mexican restaurant. It is a very good price and the plates are big enough. Roma neighborhood.
	
		Mi gusto es/Fishers/La Ostra: They are a seafood restaurant and offer very tasty options.


	
	These are some suggestions, but there are plenty good, cheap and nice restaurants in these neighborhoods. It is difficult to stay updated as they open one almost each month.

Middle East Travel



...............................................................................

Montreal to Campbellton, New Brunswick by Rail

	‘Murder on the Orient Express’, ‘The Lady Vanishes’, ‘Casey Jones’, The Flying Scotsman’, the worlds of literature, cinema, music and folklore are littered with stories based around the railways. Travelling by rail is arguably the best way to travel and it is definitely the best way to travel if you are not in any particular hurry. Certainly it is the most romanticised method of travel. As far as I am aware no epic sagas have ever taken place on a plane, my apologies to Samuel L. Jackson


	The railway has played an important part in the history of Canada. The settlement of the Canadian west was aided immensely by the vested interest of railway companies. Canada is big, walking or driving across it takes a long, long time. This is particularly true if where you’re going has no roads and if cars have not been invented yet. These two factors conspired to make railways both very popular and extremely profitable.

	Historically, the Canadian west has been abundant in resources while the east of the country is full of industries in demand of those resources. Getting those resources across the prairies required a herculean effort. As a condition for its entry into the Canadian Federation in 1871, British Columbia demanded a transport link to the east.

	When they had asked for a connection with the east the government of British Columbia had intended for the creation of a wagon road, but Prime Minister John A. Macdonald instead proposed a railway. Construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway began in 1881 with the first spike being driven in Bonfield, Ontario. A scant six years later in 1887 the first official train arrived in what is now Vancouver.

	The genius of the men who plotted the Canadian Pacific Railway is not to be found in the completion of the project. That victory belongs to the workers who laboured to traverse the Canadian wilderness in six short years. No, the genius of the men who envisioned the railway can be found in their long term thinking. They had built a railway through a massive portion of the world where people who would have had need of a railway did not live and so, they decided to make their railway even more valuable by importing people to live beside it.

	As a part of the contract the Canadian Pacific Railway Company was awarded 100,000 square kilometres of land. The Canadian Pacific Railway Company duly embarked on chartering some boats and offered land and transport to families in Europe to come and settle the Canadian Prairies. By doing this they ensured that a demand would always exist for their shiny new railway. The people that had settled the prairies had to live near to the railway in order to have any link to the world. It is here that the true Machiavellian genius of the minds that devised the Canadian Pacific Railway can be seen.

	Winnipeg, Manitoba saw its population explode from 25,000 people in 1891 to more than 179,000 in 1921, a rise which coincides with the arrival of the Canadian Pacific Railway. Saskatchewan, Manitoba’s neighbour to the west, saw it’s population rise sharply too as a direct result of the arrival of the railway. Given the importance of the train to the history of Canada it seems somewhat fitting that we spent some time on one during our trip across the country.

	It takes seventeen hours to get from Montreal to Moncton by train. Before I went to Canada the longest that I had ever spent on a bus was when I went from Dublin to Killarney, a journey that took six hours.  Before Canada this, to me, was a long journey. After Canada I find six hours to be entirely reasonable and journeys of three hours or less are barely worth talking about.

	Having completed a thirteen hour bus trip from Banff to Jasper the thought of a seventeen hour train journey was not as daunting as it may seem. After all, what’s four hours between friends? It may not have seemed like much at the time but in reality it took longer to get from Montreal to Moncton than it did to get from Dublin to Vancouver and that is including a three hour layover in London.

	My girlfriend is blessed with the ability to turn sleep on and off like a tap. She can sleep when she likes, for as long as she likes, wherever she likes. I, on the other hand, am unable to sleep while in transit for anything more than half an hour. Not only did I spend sixteen and a half hours of the overnight train journey wide awake, I also spent them alone, as my travelling companion was asleep with her head under a blanket.

	Our journey took us out of Montreal and then through north east Quebec. As the journey took place at night, I can tell you very little about Quebec outside of Montreal. What I can tell you is that there is a place called Saint-Louis-du-Ha! Ha! a place that I now very much want to visit based on name alone.

	As the train sped on through the darkness I tried to pass the time. I read, I stared at the back of the seat in front of me, I contemplated ‘accidentally’ waking Anna up and interspersed all of this with futile attempts to sleep. We had left Montreal at 5pm so it was in a ragged, tired and agitated state that I found myself in Campbellton, in the Province of New Brunswick at 7am the following morning.

	As the train idled at the station in Campbellton the dawn was beginning to break over New Brunswick. It was now early December and the deep, darkness of a winter’s night had grown paler and was changing to an orange hue as the sun began to ascend over the Chaleur Bay. As the train pulled out from the station the sun had climbed high enough to illuminate rolling waves and circling gulls. With a tired smile all agitation left me as I realised that I was now looking out at the sparkling waters of the Atlantic Ocean. I had left Vancouver a few weeks earlier with this moment in my mind. I had made it from sea to sea.

	On any morning Campbellton would have been picturesque but set against the day that was now breaking it was simply glorious. Neat, detached wooden houses sat amidst rolling hillocks that bristled with wild, overgrown grass that swaying back and forth in the breeze from the bay. Campbellton dates from the 1700’s and age has given the town an eternal feeling. I could tell just from looking at it that this was a place where lives had been lived.

	The wind would howl and drive cold, stinging rain against rattling window panes. The alkaline air of the salty sea would chip paint and the moisture would warp floorboards, but the people of Campbellton had endured it all and would continue to endure it regardless. Life would go on as it always had. Campbellton represented shelter from the storm and comfort amidst the wild. I would like to live somewhere like Campbellton.

	As the train trundled past Campbellton it followed the coastline and I began to get the sinking feeling that by overlooking New Brunswick we had made a huge mistake. Occasionally the bare and windswept coast would be swallowed by thick forest that I would eagerly peer into in the hope that I would see a moose through a gap in the trees, I had no such luck.

	Sometimes, if we are very lucky we find a place in the world that the sight of it resonates with us. It is a feeling beyond the mere appreciation of natural beauty; it is something far more fundamental and transcendent, as if something in the very fabric of our being has recognised a comfortable and familiar space, a landscape that mirrors the soul. It is wonderful and it is calming and it feels as if this place was created for you and for you alone. While a train full of people may have passed along that stretch of coastline outside of Campbellton on that Saturday morning I felt as if I was the only one who truly saw it.

	The image of that glorious, winter-bright morning, which was perhaps more bright and clear than any other morning that I have ever experienced, that morning, from the breaking dawn on the Chaleur Bay to the fleeting glimpses of white-capped waves rolling into shore, seen from a train travelling over 100km an hour is one of the most treasured memories that I took home from my entire Canadian adventure.

Paid TEFL Teaching Jobs: Gulf Arab States
(Saudi Arabia, Dubai, Qatar, Oman, Kuwait, Bahrain & Abu Dhabi) – Tremendous oil wealth and a desire to become international players in the economic and political arenas have led the Arab countries of the Persian Gulf region to invest billions of dollars into their educational systems, particularly English language instruction. As a result, qualified English teachers are offered very attractive pay and benefits packages to come to teach.
However, because the number of opportunities is only a fraction of what is found in Asia or Europe, the job market can be exceedingly competitive (an MA and/or a professional background in education is often required for many positions). 

Highlights of working in the Persian Gulf region:

 * Salaries ranging from $2,000 - $5,000 per month (tax-free).
 * Benefits may include free health insurance, furnished housing/housing stipend, and flights to and from your home country.
 * An opportunity to experience a region rich in culture and history.

Positive Outlook for the New Year & 2011 Gap Years
Need help planning a gap year? Oyster Worldwide is a small and well regarded Gap year organisation sending volunteers and paid workers to 11 destinations worldwide.
Despite the sudden hitch in student tuition fees, set to come into practice for the 2012 cohort, travel reviews site TripAdvisor is predicting an increase in gap year travelers over the next year.

TripAdvisor’s annual travel trend’s survey, which spanned 6,200 people from the UK, revealed that two thirds of respondents are planning to take a lot of time out in the New Year.

However this does come at a price. Only 10% of respondents said that they would be taking environmental issues into consideration when planning their trips- in comparison to 14% from the last survey. It is assumed that this is due to the all-important cost cutting methods.

Despite this, it is indeed a positive stance for the New Year. Many people will actually be better off volunteering abroad for several months than their counterparts who stay in the UK looking for work or scarce university places. Developing your CV, your personal experiences and indeed your independence are extremely valuable assets at the moment- so stand out from the crowd and jump on that band wagon!

Primate Gap Year Volunteer Projects Cameroon, Africa
Take a gap year and volunteer with primates. Two of Ape Action Africa's primates received a very special visitor recently - British Neurophysiotherapist Kirsty Godwin-Pearson. At home, Kirsty treats people with neurological conditions, using physiotherapy to aid their recovery and help them regain function. She travelled to Cameroon to work closely with Samburu, a young chimp left paralysed by meningitis and Maggie, a mandrill who suffers severe fits.
In her two weeks at Mefou, Kirsty visited Samburu twice a day for physiotherapy sessions and trained his carer Franklin on techniques that help Samburu use his paralysed arm. The little chimp has made excellent progress and instead of dragging his right arm behind him, he is now using it to feed himself and even climb small trees.

Kirsty also worked with Maggie, a gentle, two-year-old female Mandrill, who suffers from serious fits, poor balance and sensory problems. Maggie’s frequent fitting made it difficult for Kirsty to treat her, but she spent several hours a day in Maggie’s cage, encouraging her to eat using her hands. Until now, Maggie has only been able to eat by lying on her stomach and taking food into her mouth from the floor.

Kirsty is passionate about primate conservation, saying “for a while now I have felt that primates with neurological problems would benefit from neurophysiotherapy in the same way humans do. They are very similar to us...and get very frustrated from not being able to move around and use their limbs normally.”

As far as Ape Action Africa know Kirsty is the first specialist Neurophysiotherapist in the world to have worked with primates and we are grateful for the huge improvements she has made in the lives of Samburu and Maggie.

Some volunteer organizations, charities offer offer volunteer placements at refugee camps and centers in Africa.
Inspire Volunteering offer placements at the Kakuma Refugee Camp volunteer placement in Kenya, Africa.

Volunteering at Kakuma camp for children and refugees: A unique and special project in remote Kenya. Kakuma refugee camp is in the northern corner of Kenya bordering Sudan and Uganda. Juba which is a major town in southern Sudan is only 424km from Kakuma. This refugee camp was as a result of an ensuing war in Sudan. Thousands of Sudanese were given safe haven in Kenya and as a result the UN had to come out to try and empower this people so that they can be enlightened and educated when they get back to their country. Kakuma also has a small town town that in a few years has rapidly grown to a small commercial centre. The area is semi arid and has temperatures that go up to 45c.The indigenous people here are called the Turkanas, they are a nomadic tribe that herds cattle and sheep. They tend to move from one place to the other looking for pasture. Due to these you will notice that their houses are semi permanent. The whole area apart from the UN compound which is basically developed the rest of the area  is encompassed by mud and stick huts. 

Kakuma Refugee Camp is divided into 7 units in a an area of hundreds of square kilometers. This is for purposes of better administration. Kakuma also encompasses other refugees from other countries in the region that have war in their country. These are the Ugandans, Congolise, Somalis and Ethiopians. Currently the UN has been repatriating Sudanese refugees back to their homes on voluntary bases and many have left the camp, because of this they are also transferring Somali Bantus from another camp called Dadaab to Kakuma because of its organization and space left by the Sudanese who went back home.

INTERESTING FACTS ABOUT KAKUMA

Kakuma has very many interesting and attractive things which a volunteer will really find amusing and at times life changing. There are trees that are so poisonous  that one has to be careful  what they touch.. There are snakes and scorpions and one also has to check their rooms well before they sleep.Most interesting aspect is that Kakuma being in lower lands their main water sources are rivers. These rivers flow from Uganda which is bordering Kakuma, so one moment the river beds are dry and the next the water is flowing. This is because Uganda is mountainous and rains a lot.The Turkana community attire which is traditional is also very amazing to see. Most of the children also walk nude because of the very high temperatures. These among the many interesting things you get to see in Kakuma.
	
Volunteering at kakuma camp for children and refugees

This is a school that caters for children between 5 years and 6 years old. It is situated in the heart of the camp. It is a school that offers education to Sudanese refugees from a predominantly large ethnic group called Equatorial tribe from Southern part of Sudan.The school teaches early childhood education using the Kenyan system of education. This was among the very first schools to be constructed in the camp. Most of the children who have gone and become adults and among them the Lost Boys of Sudan went through this school. This school is among 7 pre- schools in the whole of Kakuma camp..

STAFF OF THE SCHOOL

The school has a population of 120 children. It has only 3 teachers including the head teacher. It has 2 support staff, these are a watchman and a cook. All the teachers are from the Sudan community as they are encouraged to work in their own schools thus empowering them for the future of their country

SCHOOL ACTIVITIES

The school due to lack of teaching materials the children use chalk slates. This is never viable and good because they erase the work every time there is a new subject, thus the progress and records of the child is not well monitored..

DUTIES OF SCHOOL TEACHERS AND VOLUNTEERS

- Teachers report at the school at 7.30am.
- Inspection of toilets, classroom and supervision of sweeping of the compound. This is because of the dusty condition of the camp.
- Supervise that the tables and chairs are in place for the commencement of the lessons.
- Tires are also arranged and put into place. These are basically car tires which are used by the children to play with.
- By 8 am, the children are received at the gate. This helps to create an environment of friendliness and care which acts as a motivator for the children to attend class.
- Ringing of the bell where all children assemble for a parade where they pray, and the days activities are communicated to them. It also brings this small community together.
- The children are checked for hygiene. This is for teaching basic cleanliness it includes checking nails, clean clothes, clean groomed faces etc.
- They then go to class and teaching starts. These includes reading, writing , coloring, nursery rhymes etc Note that the volunteer here has to follow the time-table and curriculum offered in the school. Help and assist in anyway possible.
- School breaks at 10 am for a snack and play for around 30 min before they go back to class.
- School breaks at 12.30 pm because there is a lot of heat most activities in the camp almost come to a halt and resume at 3 pm when it gets cooler.
- The volunteer can break for lunch and take a break at the mess then prepare for the next  day after the day cools down. 

FEEDING PROGRAM

The school also has a feeding program where children are given porridge  and biscuits at 10.30 am. This also acts as a motivator for the parents to bring their children to school instead of keeping them at home. Volunteers are encouraged to assist in the making of food and thus be pro active and help the limited staff.

OTHER INFORMATION

The classes are divided into two with 60 children in one classes. This is so because they lack enough  teachers. Most interesting is that they have a lot of space  but they are forced to use only two rooms only. The school head teacher is a very humble lady who works tirelessly to ensure that these children get the best education possible. Due to the repatriation of the refugees to their country the school had been closed down for some time. As a result the school lacks many resources and  they are just working to equip it  again. Another reason that the organization is working very hard to return to normalcy is the upsurge of many refugees from Somali who  are being transferred to Kakuma.

NAPHTALI EMPOWERMENT CENTER

This is a part of a wide network of empowerment activities just in the outskirts of the Kakuma Camp. The community that hosts the refugees in the camp came up with a program where as much as the refugees were getting help the indigenous tribe here also needed education and a lot of empowerment They are a nomadic group and a result were not getting any education because of moving around. The area semi-arid these people rarely lived in one place at a given time. As a result there was need to start this center. This center has a primary school, an adult literacy class, a child worker trainee school or teacher training, a feeding program for the children and the community, a small bush school for children who are unable to access the school and a church for spiritual guidance. It also has started a small children orphanage  with  11 children   living in a semi-permanent structure made of mud. Recently the structure fell apart and the children are now living in the local pastors house temporarily.

These activities below encompass the Empowerment center. Again volunteers can engage with this as much as possible and in any way required.

ECHAMI LEARNING CENTER

School is located on the out skirts of the camp. This means it is not in the camp. The school however caters for both Refugees and indigenous Turkana children. The schools run by a network of community leaders and members. These include the local church, the local pastor, formers teachers of the refugee camps and the community itself. The school caters for 165 children and has a total of 7 teachers. It also has 4 supports staff that include cooks.The population of the school is mostly Turkana with Sudanese, Rwandese, and  Burundi refugees. It has 4 classes  which are from standard 1 to 4. It is run using the Kenyan education curriculum. The volunteer must also in this case be able to  work around this system which is mostly basic education. 

ACTIVITIES OF THE SCHOOL

- School starts at 8 am every day where the children attend an assembly before going to class.
- Classes start and the children  attend lessons until 10.30 am. The lessons involve   English as a language, Math, Science, Social Studies which include History, Geography, and Christian Religious Education.
- They  then break at 10.30 am for tea and porridge.
- They then return to class for classes until 12.30 where lunch is served for the children. Because none of the children go home for lunch and the support staff is not enough, the teachers are called upon to help in this exercise. So the volunteer will also be able to help and work together with the teachers.
- The children then attend classes at around 2.30 because the heat is too much and  attend more classes until  4 pm.
- They then have ball games on alternative days or attend clubs. These clubs would be like debate clubs where the children enact a parliament and debate on various issues which their little minds can comprehend. This is very interesting because you are left amazed by how bright these children are.
- The school then winds up for the day and the children run home to their small villages. 

FACILITIES OF THE SCHOOL

- They have 7 classrooms.
- A  semi-permanent kitchen
- A staff room
- A head teachers office
- Church that serves the whole community and happens to be the largest building.
- Pit latrines or pit toilets that are used by the children and teachers
- A run down semi-permanent building that used to house the orphans. 

CONSTRAINTS OF THE SCHOOL

a.    Text books are a problem as the school is unable to provide for them and the parents are very poor that they cannot afford them
b.    Exercise books
c.    Pens and pencils
d.    Uniforms for the orphans
e.    Games materials which would include  footballs, netball's, skipping ropes, and basketball
f.    Tanks to store water for the kitchen as they have to look for water from rivers
g.    Buckets and basins for serving food to the kids
h.    Mosquito nets for the orphans.
i.    Shoes for the orphans

Also note that unlike other schools Echami Center runs throughout the year expect December holidays. Over August holidays the volunteer will be able to teach and interact with the other programs that are ongoing at these period.

FEEDING PROGRAM

The feeding program is basically funded by the community through the church and well wishers. The program caters for the children and their families. Most of the community around the school cannot afford 3 meals a day. Most of them are very poor and the majority are refugees. The program is able to provide cooking flour  to the community and the children. The program works throughout the week. On weekends they go to the bush  school to feed the children who are still tied down by the cultures of their ethnic group. Most of these kids herd cattle the whole week and are only able to attend school on weekends.The feeding program on weekend also cater for  children from neighboring schools who come to the center on the weekends.

ADULT LITERACY CLASS

Turkana community having have lived for many  years following their cultural practices. Most of the adults never had a chance to an education. As  a result most of these people are illiterate.  When the refugees came to their vicinity with the UN and other organizations they were made aware of the need of an education. The class also attracted  refugees  and the program became very successful. The program still has its challenges which include small attendance when the adults think they can read and write. The main aim of the program is to teach basic English language and to read and write. The class does not run like normal school as they have their own program. It from August to December .It also only operates for only one hour per day. They are approximately 30 students at any given time .

CHILD WORKER TRAINING OR TEACHER TRAINING

This program was started by the teachers in the Echami Center. They came up with a conclusion that what the whole community lacked was a qualified teachers. Most of the schools in these area have many children who are seeking for an education but the ratio of teachers to pupils was not viable. Most of the schools have to look for volunteers or cannot afford to pay teachers. The Echami community therefore decided to come together and train these child workers. They are taught how to handle and teach children. At the end of their training they are able to teach and psychologically able to handle these children. The teachers attend classes over the holidays which are 3 months of the year. These months are April, August and December. Note that the volunteers who choose these time will be involved in the program.

POKOTOM  BUSH SCHOOL AND FEEDING PROGRAMME

This is a very interesting program. Although it is run only one day a week it is a very amazing and fun experience to get involved in. The school is basically under a tree and in inside the bush in the mountains of Turkana. The school is run by the Naphtali Empowerment Center. The school caters for the very traditional  of the Turkana group. The Pokotom project have to bring food with them so that they can attract the community to the school. The children are in proper traditional attire which is basically a beaded necklace on the waist without any loin cloth for the boys and a  cloth wrap and necklaces for the girls. Most of these children move around so much as they are a nomadic tribe that the center is trying also to enlighten the parents on the need of education and that is why the program uses feeding as way to congregate them so that they can create awareness on the importance of education.

ACTIVITIES OF THE SCHOOL

- The food is prepared  for transportation. Remember this only happens on Saturdays only.
- The food is then loaded onto bicycles for transportation. This is because  there are simply no roads so cars cannot be used
- The volunteer and the child workers then ride the bicycles to the bush. The volunteer has to be accompanied at all times to the school.
- They get to the place where they have reserved for the school and start lessons.
- The food is then given to the children.
- The distribution of the food to the community is done every fortnight
- They also organize sports for the  children . 

CONSTRAINTS

There is a need to simply construct a make shift class at least to cover the children from the very hot sun.

- Iron sheets for the small structure
- Nails
- Timber
- Books
- Pens and pencils
- Food for the program that includes flour, maize and beans.
- Text books 

HIV AND AIDS TESTING AND VOLUNTARY COUNSELING CENTER

HIV/AIDS in Africa has become a  pandemic. It has especially affected the refugees  because they are coming from a place that has war so they were not very well sensitized. Apart from that the camp has its own social difficulties that fuel the spread if the pandemic. A Voluntary Counseling and Testing Clinic is a  place where patients go and  test for the virus and at the same time time go through counseling. These clinics were opened all over Kenya to encourage people to know their status. It has been hugely successful with thousands of people attending them.

ACTIVITIES OF THE CENTER

In the Kakuma Camp it also doubles as a mobile Clinic  where the personnel at the clinic travel the vast camp see patients who are bedridden with AIDS and advising them on home-based care. These clinics are free and are funded by the government and the organizations in the camp. They also holds meeting with the refugees to create awareness on the disease. This include behavior change among the  refugees. It is important because they  have a lot of cultures that help fuel the spread of HIV. The center will also go to the homes and have what they call home level counseling and testing. The center also offers Prevention of mother to child transmission or popularly known as PMTCT. This is where they treat and offer information on how not to transmit the virus to an unborn child. Early attendance for ante-natal care and testing will help prevent these. They also offer Anti Retro viral Treatment or ARV. This is administering drugs so that the virus does not multiply and also the right foods to eat. This is the most important life saving mechanism that has been very effective to patients. It is currently prolonging many lives as patients are now living very positively.

They are also taking care of  orphans and vulnerable children who have been infected and affected by HIV/AIDS. Due to the virus affecting the body immune system TB or tuberculosis is very prevalent. They also run a very effective program for treatment and management of these disease.

Sexually transmitted diseases also fuel the spread of the virus so they also run an awareness and treatment program for these. Every week on Wednesday the center distributes condoms on dispensers that have been put around the camp. This is a condom promotion that helps in  creating awareness of safe sex. Apart from the above activities the mobile clinic makes up to 30-45 home visits every day. This is done in the afternoon as in the morning they counsel around 6 people every day who come for a first testing intervention.

FACILITIES OF THE  CENTER

- A waiting area  or reception with literature on HIV/AIDS. These is also the first time to come into contact with the patient. It also used for quality assurance. It is also the mobilization room. 

- The  next room is what is called the counseling room where the counselor  takes the patient through the counseling process. This prepares them on how to take the test.

- The next room is where the test is administered and they keep records and charts on the  entire program. 

STAFF

They have 10 members of staff that cover all the zones  in the camp.

Rhino Gap Year Conservation Programs Africa
Luxury African travel company Mahlatini has launched a new campaign to support Rhino conservation in Africa. The travel retailer which is based in Belfast has teamed up with the Amakhala Game Reserve, in South Africa to help raise awareness of the serious issue of illegal Rhino poaching; which is pushing Black and White Rhinos to the brink of extinction making them an endangered species.
Amakhala, a unique conservation initiative that allows animals to be re-introduced to the area where they once roamed freely, is one of the stunning African destinations Mahlatini operate holidays to. The Mahlatini team have all lived or travelled extensively in Africa and are passionate about the continent. The company’s name is even a Zulu word meaning ‘love of the African bush’. They are committed to supporting the excellent and vital work that Amakhala and other conservation projects conduct in order to preserve the continent’s beautiful landscape and wildlife. 

Greg Fox of Mahlatini said ‘We are extremely proud to support the extraordinary and essential work of Amakhala and raise awareness of other conservation efforts in Africa. In 2009 in South Africa alone, 122 Rhinos were butchered for their horns and the figure nearly tripled in 2010. As an organisation that benefits from the beauty of this amazing continent it’s only right that we use our profile and position to help raise awareness of this delicate situation. Otherwise, future generations will not be able to experience seeing this unique and fascinating animal in its natural environment –only in zoos.’ 

In order to assist in raising awareness of this crisis the Mahlatini team have sponsored one of Amakhala’s baby Rhinos, Themba, which means ‘hope’ in Zulu. To celebrate the new addition to their team and elevate the profile of the struggle against Rhino poachers Mahalatini has launched a competition with Rhino sponsorship packages as prizes. 

Entrants are required to simply spread the word through social media – on a blog or website, or through Facebook and Twitter. They can enter via all three methods and the winners will receive a whole host of benefits including a cuddly toy Rhino, a fact book and regular updates on their Rhino. 

The campaign will run until 20th May 2011 and more information on the competition, Rhino conservation and poaching can be found on the Mahlatini website www.mahlatini.com/stop-rhino-poaching.

Media enquiries: Victoria Yates on 0845 862 0416 (ext 7021) or victoriay@wmps.com

Mahlatini is a luxury travel operator specialising in trips to Africa. Named after the Zulu word meaning ‘lover of the African bush’ the company operates holidays to 13 African countries including Botswana, South Africa, Kenya and Mauritius.

The company, which is based in Belfast, Northern Ireland has been operating for over 9 years and is a division of Luxury Travel Ltd. Mahlatini is a member of the Travel Trust Association, ATOL and Advancing Tourism to Africa (ATTA).

	A Guide to Going Diving in Cambodia

	

	Cambodia is a very enjoyable place to either learn to dive, or join an advanced course/trip. Water temperatures average around 28°C year round and if you are lucky you might get to see moray eels, reef sharks, sea turtles and whale sharks. What makes Cambodia such an appealing dive destination is that there are new dive sites found every week, and the waters around the South coast have still to be explored! Compared to other countries where you can find it difficult to move with the amount of tourists/divers. 

	 

	Top Reasons to Go Diving in Cambodia

	

	
		Cambodia attracts a lot less tourists than Thailand meaning the dive sites in the country are a lot less crowded
	
		The cost of the courses here are very cheap compared to some destinations in Asia
	
		See spectacular wildlife and coral
	
		Relax on some of the most incredible islands and beaches on the continent
	
		Make new friends and experience a new country/culture 
	
		The local food is delicious
	
		Do more than just sunbathing!


	 

	Best Places to Go Diving in Cambodia

	

	Koh Koun and Koh Rong Samloem are probably the most popular dive site located about 1-2 hours away from Sihanoukville and close to Koh Rong Samleom. There are beginners dive trips, advanced excursions and also night dives available here, dive depth range from 3m – 25m and visibility is usually good, around 3m – 15m. One of the reasons this area is so popular is because is is a protected marine site, due to local conservation efforts the coral, marine flora and fauna is very healthy. Local dive centres also offer overnight dive trips to remote dive sites around Koh Tang, Koh Prins and Koh Pulawei.

	 

	Scuba Diving in Sihanoukville

	

	If you are thinking about staying or and going diving in Sihanoukville we have put together some useful information which should help you.

	You can travel by private/public bus from Siem Reap or Phnom Penh to Sihanoukville. The journey from Siem Riep takes about 10 hours so you will need to leave early in the morning or catch an overnight transport. There are plenty of interesting stops along the way making for an exciting journey...choices include a visit to a bamboo sticky rice cake making workshop or Spider town (harbouring…you guessed it, tarantulas!!) 

	Most people stay close to the beach in Sihanoukville (as seen above). We also recommend going to stay on the island of Koh Rong Samloem. Accommodation can be included in the price of some dive packages or you can just find somewhere independently, there are great value beach bungalows, hotels and hostels available.

	You’ll have the opportunity to take part in one of the many local activities – try visiting waterfalls, or taking a trip out to one of the nearby islands to enjoy a great day of snorkelling in the beautiful clear blue waters. In the evenings, enjoy Sihanoukville’s night life and join in on optional dinners with your group and later visit some of the many local bars for a game of pool, a cocktail or 10, up to you, or just let loose on the dance floor!

Teach English in Cambodia

	While Thailand remains popular with many foreign teachers, Cambodia has benefited from the exposure and limelight their south-eastern neighbour has received in recent years. Cambodia has witnessed growth in tourism over the past decade, with the number of visitors to the region increasing by 15 per cent over that period; many of whom embark on a job teaching English.

Acquiring proficiency in English is a great way in which Cambodian youth and adults can pass exams, graduate from school, go on to secure employment in areas like tourism, and actively participate in Cambodia&#39;s developing modern society.

	"My students were so friendly, they didn&#39;t speak very good English but were so keen to learn every day. Be prepared for basic classroom materials and take as many things from home as you can e.g. paper, pens etc. I feel I gained the respect and gratitude of all the local teachers and I really was able to help for the 2 months I was in Cambodia. I couldn&#39;t recommend this experience highly enough."  - C Adams, USA 

	"The children were so upbeat and their positive attitude really helps you enjoy the experience. Some days were tough and challenging but you also get a lot of free time during the week to see more of your surroundings. I didn&#39;t really know what to expect when I applied but I really enjoyed my time in Cambodia - it is such a beautiful country. Be sure to head to the beaches and also see Angor Wat.&#39; - K Wilson, UK

Teach English in Egypt

	Apply to work as an English teacher in Egypt and experience this magical and unique country for yourself. Search language schools and companies offering TEFL jobs throughout Egypt.


	Guide to Teaching in Egypt

	If you are looking to experience life in a country which has recently been through a historic period in its history and has a bright future ahead then you might really enjoy living and teaching in Egypt. Expect culture and lots of places to visit in your spare time, Egypt is one of the oldest civilizations in the world and seeing the Pyramids is a must. There’s a recognised demand for English in Egypt, it’s a great time to relocate if you want to teach English as a foreign language. 

	Many graduates take a year out after their studies before following their career path, a lot of them try to see more of the world by finding work as a language teacher in a foreign country like Egypt. Some don’t just stay for a year, though: they stay indefinitely and even set up their own language school, thiis country will appeal to you if you are looking to experience a totally different culture. 

	Egypt is home to the stunning Pyramids of Giza – one of the most important archaeological sites on earth as well as one of the most famous tourist attractions, and a definite inclusion on any ‘must-see’ list – this is a country where ancient history mixes with the present everywhere you go. From the busy, bustling streets of Cairo to the splendour of the Nile, the amazing sights of ancient Luxor and the many other sites of historic interest, teaching jobs in Egypt invariably offer an experience like no other. There is so much to take in, and so much choice, that it can take months of living and working here to fully experience the land of the pharaohs.

	 

	Where to Find Teaching Jobs in Egypt

	You can find English teaching jobs in places like:

	
		Alexandria
	
		Cairo
	
		Dahab
	
		Sharm El Sheik


	 

	Best Time to Find ESL Employment in Egypt

	All year round with most recruiters hiring in January and September.

	 

	What is Included in Job Packages

	Most jobs will not include airfare, accommodation and meals. Also it will be difficult to find a job with paid holidays. If you are a single female is it worth considering if Egypt is a good destination for you, there is a culture in this region where jobs are usually given to men.

	 

	Cost of Living

	The general low cost of living in Egypt makes it easier to manage your personal finance, leaving you to reap the full rewards from your teaching job. The general cost of living is fairly low in Egypt for TEFL teachers. Electricity bills, for instance, cost roughly the equivalent of $15 per month and petrol prices are reasonably low. Eating out is also affordable and cheaper than teaching English in Israel or other nearby countries.

	 

	Salary

	Wages are usually lower in Egypt compared to other countries in the Middle East like Dubai but they are usually the highest in North Africa. Expect around 5,000- 12,000 Egyptian Pounds (EGP) per month this is around £500 ($700). Leading private lessons pays the best and even in these turbulent times there are still lots of jobs on offer.

	Also don’t forget when you’re making a living from teaching you will have to manage your personal finances while you’re out there as well. This includes your tax affairs and coping with the general cost of living. Businesses that are based in Egypt must pay tax on all of their worldwide income, with a corporation tax on all company profits. They must file their tax return within four months of the end of the tax year. If you live in Egypt for more than 183 days per year, you must pay income tax. This is as much as 25% on income over 10 million Egyptian pounds per year. Register there as a resident for tax purposes to avoid double taxation. 

	 

	Safety

	Please check latest travel advice before departing or e-mail us for advice about teaching English abroad in Egypt.

	 

	How to Get a TEFL Job in Egypt

	Remember that even though you’ve come to teach English, you should also learn the local language. This is not only a sign of respect: it will allow you to become more familiar with the culture and build up a rapport with Arabic-speaking people. So if you’re planning to teach English or even start up your own language school out in Egypt, prepare by studying for TEFL qualification in Egypt and learning some Arabic to help your venture run smoothly. Also set up a bank account to help manage your business’s finances more comfortably.

Teach English in Ghana

	Looking for a rewarding experience? Apply to work as a teacher in Ghana!


	 

	Guide to Teaching in Ghana

	Help teachers in Ghana provide desperately needed education to school children and youngsters. There are lots of wonderful rewarding teaching projects in places like the northern townships of Accra. The children who attend the school are between the ages of 3 to 12. They learn topics such as math, science, French, and moral education. Many children from this area come from low-income families and are obligated to leave school to work in order to help support their families. The teachers and staff recognize this and try to provide a high quality education to every child who steps through the gates of the school in hopes of seeing them through elemetary school. They have limited resources to work with, but they use their creativity to make learning enjoyable for everyone. Volunteers can help with this meaningful objective. 

	On these placements you will have a supporting role as teacher&#39;s assistant. There will be lots of different material covered in class, so you can help to mentor the children and give them some extra one-on-one attention where necessary. At lunch hour, help serve lunch and play with the children in the courtyard. Your help will go a long way just by showing your support to the teachers, or by helping to prepare classroom materials. It is certain that the children will be just as excited about you being there as you will be! There are no particular skills required to volunteer on this project except for a love of children! This also means you should be patient, flexible and ready to help out wherever you are needed. If you have teaching experience, the staff at the school will help you determine where your skills can be the most helpful. 

	School and projects are closed for two weeks during Christmas and New Years, from mid-April until mid-May, and for summer holidays from July 26 to September 9.

	 

	 

	Ghana Teaching Experiences & TEFL Reviews

	Tom Kent from the UK participated on a teaching placement in Ghana and this is how he got on: "When we arrived we were greeted by a sea of smiling and laughing ten year old faces, and immediately invited to join the huge chaotic game of football going on. A friendly teacher called Kwame allocated us teams, and a riotous game commenced. Countless fouls later and after everyone was well and truly shattered, a sweaty group of white English boys accompanied the crowd of panting children into the canteen. Jolly canteen staff asked us how our game had been and teased everyone about how dusty we all were. As we sat stuffing our faces, amid a horde of giggling children, Ghanaians had proved to be a very welcoming bunch and the experience turned out to be amazing which will live with me forever."

	Best Time to Get a Teaching Job

	There is a high demand for English teachers in Guatemala all year round and no best time to apply.

	 

	 

	

	Where to Find Teaching Work

	Very few jobs are advertised on the internet and most are found locally either by going into to language schools or in local newspapers. Most people find teaching vacancies at private language schools where there are more jobs and the wages tend to be higher. Some language schools can also help you other insentives like discounted accommodation but sometimes working hours can be long. Some charities and non-profit organisations recruit English teachers to help improve education among local communities. Sometimes a small stipend salary is offered. You can also give private lessons to supplement your income, you are best advertising your services locally on messageboards and in-person. 

	 

	 

	Visa

	You can enter Guatemala on a tourist visa which is valid for 90 days and then teach English which is what most people do. Language schools can get around the red tape of people not having a work visa by offering teachers a ‘living allowance’ rather than a salary, you can expect to be paid cash in hand. If you would like to stay longer than 3 months you can extentd your visa or cross into a neighbouring country and back again.

	 

	 

	Requirements and Elibility

	Guatemala doesn&#39;t generally have strict criteria for teaching English, lots of language schools hire teachers without a degree or any official TEFL certififcation. If you are wondering if you can teach in Guatemala without a degree then yes you can. We recommend taking a TEFL course though as this will help prepare you for teaching in Guatmeala.

	 

	 

	Salary for Teaching in Guatemala

	Guatemala isn&#39;t the country to teach if you want to get rich, wages here are very low compared to other worldwide TEFL destinations. Please note Guatemala is a developing country, there are a selection of paid teaching jobs in Guatemala but a lot are un-paid. You should be able to get by even with the low wages as the cost of living is also very low. If you are looking to gain experience you might want to check out our volunteer programs in Guatemala.

	 

	 

	Cost of Living

	Guatemala is a great value destination, accommodation, hotels, hostels, food and transport are cheap compared to other country in this region. To save money we recommend eating local food, either buying at markets or locally run cafes and restraurants and avoid Western companies where prices are higher.

	 

	 

	Health & Safety

	Guatemala had a brutal civil war a few decades ago but now this country is very safe and developing at an fast pace. You shouldn&#39;t encounter any issues when teaching here.

	 

	

	What to Do in Your Spare Time

	Guatemala shares borders with Mexico, Belize, Honduras and El Salvador and there will be lots of opportunities for you to explore in your spare time. Guatemala is a country steeped in tradition, there are ancient ruins from the Maya civilisation which are still scattered around the country.

Teach English in Guyana

	Guyana is probably a country you haven&#39;t considered when thinking about going to teach English overseas. Guyana is situated in North Eastern South America and is an exotic country relatively undiscovered. There is a real need for native English speaking teachers and very little competition for jobs with both paid and voluntary positions available.


	 

	Guide to Teaching Abroad in Guyana

	Guyana has a tropical climate and some beautiful beaches, scenery and friendly and welcoming people. This is a vibrant country to work as an English teacher, as local people speak English there is a smaller need for TEFL teachers although there are jobs available and less teachers head here to work meaning the better the chances of getting employment. 

	This might suprise you but English is the official language of Guyana but they converse in a slightly different dialect known as Creole. Guyana used to be part of the British colony and now people speak a mixture of English with a combination of Caribbean. Teaching in Guyana can be an eye opening experience, facilities can be basic and living conditions basic to what you might be used to. This will be the challenge of your life.

	 

	 

	Top Reasons to Teach in Guyana

	
		There is a warm tropical climate

	Visa

	To work in Guyana you will need to apply for a working visa, this will need to be arranged by your employer and costs around £100 (US$140).

	 

	 

	Requirements for Teaching in Guyana

	Most employers will require you to be a native English speaker, with previous experience and a bachelor’s degree. A TEFL certificate is not a necessity but it will improve your chances of finding work.

	 

	 

	Top Tips to Get a Job Teaching in Guyana

	Very few positions are advertised online and so we recommend going to language schools once in the country. It is better to meet and talk to hiring managers face to face although you could also e-mail or phone them in advance.

Teach English in Myanmar

	There is a growing demand for English teachers in Myanmar (Burma), this country is making huge strides forward and local people are now keen to learn or improve their English skills. Although, you won’t be rich teaching in Myanmar, you will get an authentic experience and the cost of living is very low. Teaching in Myanmar will be a life changing experience you will never forget!


	Guide to Teaching in Myanmar

	Myanmar (previously known as Burma) is a country located in Southeast Asia and is one of the more exotic countries for TEFL teachers. Myanmar shares borders with Bangladesh, China, India, Laos and Thailand and you will get lots of time to explore your new surroundings in your spare time. You will get a unique experience and be able to be immersed in the country whilst helping friendly local students.  

	As a teacher in Myanmar you will be able to fill the vital role of sharing knowledge and skills to help young adult students reach their goals related to community development. Teachers are needed for a range of classes, mostly pre-Intermediate English classes focused on academic, listening and speaking classes. Other classes include Social Sciences, Environmental studies, and workshops in areas including art, dance, public speaking, research, grant writing, etc. Teachers are encouraged to share their interests and talents with prior approval.

	Teachers generally spend 3 hours/ day up to 20 hours/ week in the classrooms. You will be able to consult with the program staff in Yangon about logistical, social or academic issues that may arise. In addition to teaching and logistical support, volunteers receive some financial support to offset their expenses during their placement and support arranging an appropriate visa. Working as a teacher in Burma requires pragmatism, patience, independence, initiative and a genuine respect for the host people and their culture.

	 

	Top Reasons to Teach in Myanmar

	
		
			The locals are some of the friendliest in the world
		
			This country is a lot less touristy than Thailand
		
			Low rent and food costs mean you can easily save money
		
			Teachers are very respected
		
			See spectacular places in your spare time
		
			The country is free from Western commercialism - get here before the big companies arrive
	


	 

	Best Time to Seek Employment

	There is no best time to teach in Myanmar.

	 

	Top Tips for Teaching in Myanmar

	There are lots of different languages spoken with Myanmar being the official, you might want to learn to words and phrases which will help make the experience more enjoyable. Some local people also already speak English, this is due to the colonial days of Burma when it was under British rule. You might want to consider taking an online TEFL course in Myanmar or search TEFL certifications in Asia. We also recommend avoiding talking about politics with local people.

	 

	Why the Need for English Teachers

	Myanmar is welcoming a new age of democracy and has opened its doors to international visitors and tourist is growing rapidily which in turn is bringing in investment and boosting the local economy. Tourism is going to be one of the biggest employers in the country and so people both young and old are keen to get to grips with the English language which will provide them with a better career and more money.

	 

	Best Places to Seek TEFL Employment in Myanmar

	Most English teaching jobs are available in the larger cities like Yangon (Rangoon) and Mandalay. There are opportunities to teach in more rural locations but jobs are limited.

	 

	How to Get a Teaching Job in Myanmar

	It is difficult to find teaching jobs in advance, most positions are not advertised on the internet. There are an increasing amount of private language schools and international schools opening up in Myanmar and our best recommendation is to seek out jobs locally whilst in Myanmar by going door to door to language schools. Local newspapers and jobs boards usually have postings for TEFL jobs which can be a good way to find vacancies. You will usually need to have an interview in person and the process is usually very quick compared to some countries which are made more difficult with red tape.

	 

	Salary 

	Wages for teaching in Myanmar are low compared to teaching in Asia and countries nearby. A lot of positions are unpaid which is perfect if you would like to give back, help local people and make a difference through volunteering in Myanmar. If you have experience, a degree and a certification you are likely to be paid more.

	 

	Visa

	Most people enter Myanmar on a tourist visa and then either work cash in hand or after you have got a job, you can apply for a Myanmar business visa. You will need an invitation or recommendation from a language school to obtain a business visa.

	 

	Eligibility, Requirements & Qualifications

	Every school has different eligibility criteria, some require minimum qualifications or just enthauaism whilst others will required certifications like a TESOL, CELTA or TEFL course, a BA degree and previosu teaching experience.

	Ideal candidates:

	
		Speak English with native-fluency
	
		Can commit for 10 weeks – 12 months, with some exceptions
	
		Are flexible and hard working people with experience living in developing counties
	
		Have teaching experience or strong academic backgrounds
	
		Are aware and culturally sensitive to Myanmar’s traditions and ways of life


	 

	Health & Safety

	Despite what you might think, Myanmar is a very safe country to teach in. The military rule is over and although this country isn&#39;t as developed as other nations, it is not as basic as you might think. If you do encounter any problems healthwise though we recommend crossing the border into Thailand to seek medical attention.

Teach English in the Middle East
Take a TEFL course and teach in the Middle East. Schools in Egypt, Jordan, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and other Middle Eastern nations all seek certified English teachers. In many Arab nations, university classes are taught in English and the region’s location at the crossroads of East and West has made cities like Dubai major hubs of commerce and leisure where English is the norm. In wealthy Gulf States in particular, most positions are offered to experienced teachers with bachelors’ or masters’ degrees in education, in addition to a TEFL / TESOL certification.
Those who qualify for such positions will enjoy some of the highest salaries in the field as pay can range from $ 2,500 - $ 6,000 a month, plus free housing and flights to and from the teacher’s home country. Jobs are somewhat easier to come by for those with just a four-year degree (or even less) and a TEFL/TESOL Certification in Egypt, Morocco, Jordan, and Turkey, where the pay is considerably lower, but the cost of living is low and the opportunities for immersion in one the world’s great regions for culture and history are innumerable.

Some points about teaching in the Middle East:

 * The vast majority of positions in the Gulf Countries (Saudi Arabia, UAE, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, and Oman) are obtained through interviews in advance.
 * Teachers should expect to adhere to local cultural norms, which can vary dramatically from what you may be used to in the West. Within the region, restrictions on personal freedoms like style of dress and the right to consume alcohol can vary widely from country to country, or even from region to region within a particular country.
 * The presence of large expatriate communities, where teachers can socialize with other westerners makes the transition for newcomers to the region much easier.

There are lots of TEFL jobs in Vietnam for English speakers, both international and local companies recruit foreign staff all year round to work in schools, universities and language centers. 


	Guide to Teaching English in Vietnam

	

	Vietnam is an up and coming destination which has culture, history, tradition and welcoming people. It is also much cheaper to live in compared to teaching in Thailand or other countries in Asia for example which makes it easier to save money.

	Vietnam is on the rise after decades of war and poverty, with Vietnam boasting a safe place to live with one of the fastest growing economies in the World, according to the World Economic Forum. Vietnam continually attracts a flow of foreign teachers although Laos has been hailed by commentators as one the planet&#39;s emerging destinations for those looking to searching for a more exotic teaching abroad destination. If you are not yet qualified view our TEFL certification courses in Vietnam.

	Don&#39;t let Vietnam&#39;s brutal past put you off teaching here, this country is very safe. This country has a booming TEFL market, there are jobs available for beginners who are newy qualified and for more experienced teachers. Its easier to find work in the main cities where there are more schools and language centres. There is a big market for foreigner workers from affluent Vietnamese people who are seeking private lessons. Local people are increasingly keen to learn English to enhance their employment opportunities in different industries like the booming oil and tourism industry. Applying for private TEFL jobs can be quite lucrative and a better bet for making money than in public schools. 

	Each new day teaching in Vietnam is an exciting adventure where you will be thrilled, challenged, delighted and exhausted all at once. There are so many places you can find work, from large cities like Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon) to small coastal towns like Hue and Nha Trang. View our guide to teaching in Vietnam and apply today.

	 

	Best Places to Work as a Teacher in Vietnam

	Depending on your job you can have a much different experience, for example the cities can be really fun but if you are looking for a more relaxing stay head to the coast or smaller towns away from Saigon and Hanoi. Noise and pollution can be a problem and also rents are much higher in these two cities but this is also where most jobs can be found. Below we have put together a run down of the most popular locations, please research all destinations before applying:

	Hanoi

	Hanoi is one of the most popular places to teach English, located in the North of the country this is a fascinating city to be based. This is the capital city of Vietnam and during your stay here you will need to visit the Old Quarter. Here you will find a maze of streets each specializing in particular trades such as silk, jewellery, etc. Stroll around the nearby Hoan Kiem Lake and see if you can spot 100-year-old turtles that still inhabit the waters, or strike a bargain at the night market in the heart of the district. Visit the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum; located in the centre of Ba Dinh Square, where the beloved Vietnamese leader Ho Chi Minh established the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and ultimately, where his body is kept for people to pay their respects.

	If you have the time, be sure to explore the excellent Tran Quoc Pagoda or the Temple of Literature (Van Mieu). In the evening, you will have the option of sampling some of the local food, with the Old Quarter being a popular spot to taste the local cuisine and enjoy a drink. There are also several not-for-profit restaurants, that gives street children the opportunity for vocational training and greatly changes many lives. Also one of the benefits of teaching in Hanoi is the close proximity to Ha Long Bay and Sapa - two spectacular relaxing destinations which offer a peaceful break from the frantic city life. During a short break to Ha Long Bay you will leave behind the hustle and bustle of city life and experience a relaxing cruise on a local &#39;junk&#39; boat - a must for any TEFL teacher based in Northern Vietnam.

	Ho Chi Minh City

	Most TEFL jobs in Vietnam are located in the Southern city of Ho Chi Minh, you might also know it by the previous name - Saigon.

	Hoi An

	Hoi An is a charming place to teach English and without a doubt beautifully preserved and vibrant in the evening. You will get to stroll through the picturesque streets of the old town, and marvel at the splendid colours and designs of so many lanterns. Whet your appetite with a fun local cookery class in the town that&#39;s fast becoming famous for superb food and local delicacies Rent a bike and cycle to one of Hoi An’s easily accessible and peaceful beaches. In your spare time you could visit the Japanese covered bridge, the Quan Cong Temple or the museum of History and Culture. It&#39;s paradise for shoppers in Hoi An - Tailors are on hand to produce almost any item of clothing your heart desires at very reasonable prices and it&#39;s a haven for arts & crafts including beautiful lanterns. Studded with lots of great bars and restaurants and you will quickly realise that Hoi An is a gem in the Vietnamese crown and you won’t want to leave!!

	Hue

	Just North of Hoi An is the imperial city of Hue. This is a more off the beaten track destination to get a teaching job. You&#39;ll have ample time to explore the historic monuments of Hue, including the former Royal Citadel – a forbidden city that was built for the Nguyen emperors. In your free time you might want to take a boat trip on the Perfume River offers a different perspective of the city or, if you are feeling more energetic, why not take a guided motorbike tour of the countryside whilst taking in some of the best sights that Hue and its surroundings has to offer. 

	 

	What to Expect 

	

	When you first arrive in Vietnam all your senses will be stimulated by the sights, smells, sounds and textures of this country. Expect students to be very friendly wanting to take you out and show you around, English teachers are held in high regard here. When working as a TEFL teacher in Vietnam you will mostly be used Monday to Friday around 5 hours per day, working at a school can be a physically exhausting day when you first start, but you soon get into the routine of early starts. If you are freelance or leading private lessons this will be different.

	 

	Salary for Teaching in Vietnam

	Vietnam can be a good choice if you are looking for your first TEFL job, you can expect wages of around $15 per hour. This really depends on your employer and also if you give private lessons.

	 

	Requirements

	
		
	
		You will need a degree to teach in Vietnam which is still a one-party socialist country. Please note Vietnam institutions are also becoming quite picky when it comes to foreign teachers and so a lot now require higher qualifications like Celta and previous experience.
	
		 
	
		Things to Do in Your Spare Time
	
		This country is an amazing destination to work as a teacher, you will also get lots of free time to explore your surroundings. You could:

	Zanzibar Teaching Testimonials & TEFL Reviews

	"I worked in Zanzibar and found the experience immensely rewarding! The founders of the school truly have the students&#39; best interests at heart. Teachers from the island of Zanzibar, the mainland, and the international community collaborate in order to provide students with the most challenging and creative educations possible. BSZ, in particular, allows for Zanzibari children to attend who may not otherwise be able to enroll in private schooling. As a teacher, I found myself invested not only in my school community but in the surrounding school neighborhoods as well.

	As an American far from fluent in the Swahili language, I found much comfort in the support and aid of my coworkers and employers during my stay on the island. All levels of staff and faculty pooled their resources in order to locate and acquire the most appropriate teaching and learning materials. Looking back on my time at BSZ, I recognize just how deeply the experience touched my life and shaped my future aspirations. I appreciate the opportunity to recommend this organization on behalf of my friends and family at BSZ." - Rachel Elbin taught English with the British School of Zanzibar

	"The children of the school were also wonderful and I loved spending time with them, and one of the reasons I intend to go back to Uganda is to visit them. I think all of the volunteers had a great time, both during the day and the night. The nightlife was wonderful, dancing to the beat of the African drums around a campfire and going to the town to have drinks and chat with the locals. I am so glad that I took part in the volunteer program and I am very sad to have had to leave. It was an experience that has given me many happy memories and it is one which I can’t wait to repeat". - Sam, UK

Teach in Zambia

	If you would like to help shape the future of Zambia you might want to become a teacher or educational and recreation assistant. 


	

	Teach in Zambia

	Children under the age of 8 are not required to attend any formal schooling and when over that age a lot do not attend due to family commitments or choosing to start a job. This means a lot of children are put at a disadvantage for future life even before it has started but there are lots of charities working to help. By choosing to join educational projects you will get to make a difference to children lives and also maybe learn a lot yourself too, placements in Zambia can be challenging due to the basic nature of classrooms especially in rural areas.

	Shockingly 20% of Zambian primary students are in community schools and the vast majority cannot read a single word by the end of Grade 2. Charities and NGO&#39;s operate projects providing equipment and literature to schools helping students progress and learn. The books incorporate full-colour photographs with simple rhymes in English, Bemba, Tonga and Nyanja and give Zambian children a rare opportunity to learn using books which reflect their own experiences of day-to-day life.

	Organisations like &#39;Teachers in Action&#39; were funded directly to produce and distribute books to early readers in community schools for young pupils who desperately need resources. You can also donate to help too, proceeds go to support worthwhile causes like the Ranchhod Hospice Daycare and Preschool and the Sables Street Kids program, both in Kabwe, Zambia. Apply to make a difference and help education efforts today.

	Things to think about when thinking about teaching in the UK

	Accommodation usually isn&#39;t included in a lot of job packages unless you are teaching at a summer school. Sometimes if you live outside of the EU it can be difficult to gain a work visa.

Ten of the best lads weekend destinations

	As a young man with a little cash and a lot of travel options, the world is your oyster – but what are the best ideas for an evening or two of fun and frivolity? You’ll want a destination, either in the UK or abroad, with drinks, good restaurants, and perhaps a night at the tables like those you’d find replicated at places like SuperCasino. Here are ten top European lads destinations for a night of mayhem.


	 

	 

	1) Riga

	The young upstart challenging Tallinn in the Baltic lads’ night league table, Riga Town Hall Square has that fascinating and fabulous architecture as a backdrop before a mazy dribble through a stunningly colourful collection of buildings in the old city. And it’s not too expensive.

	 

	 

	2) Belfast

	Everyone knows about Dublin, but what about its counterpart across the border?

	Anywhere that has a ‘Filthy Quarter’ has got to be worth a peek, especially at a venue that has its own Oktoberfest, ‘Gypsy Lounge’ and Secret Garden. There’s also some brilliant history for the morning after, including the museum of Titanic Belfast.

	 

	 

	3) London

	Where to start? Rather than trying to cover the whole city you could pick a certain area, such as Camden, Clapham, Soho or Notting Hill. Covent Garden alone will provide everything you need for a night of chaos. You could do worse than checking out TwentySomethingLondon to plan your eating and drinking around the city’s attractions.

	 

	 

	4) Krakow

	Poland has several great venues only a short flight away – Warsaw and Wroclaw are also superb – but Medieval Krakow seems to be the number one travel destination. Simple maths: Bars which scream rustic and shabby chic such as Alchemia and Singer Café, plus Eastern European beers of brutal strength, equals fun.

	 

	 

	5) Newcastle

	View the iconic bridges as you take a rampage along the Quayside to visit bars such as the Pitcher and Piano, before heading inland for the mixologists’ dreams that is Pleased to Meet You, the chic style of Livello, and the North East Bar of the Year Winner 2013 No.28. 

	 

	 

	6) Budapest

	Taking a dip in The Gellert Spa is equivalent to ‘taking a bath in a Cathedral’, so the saying goes – and it might also be the perfect place to sweat out a hangover. The Hungarian capital is actually two cities in one (Bude and Pest) with a different vibe - whatever you do check out the Ruin pubs, which are among the finest in the world. 

	 

	 

	7) Sheffield

	This vibrant university town is bursting with excellent bars and venues for a raucous night. Live music fans will be well aware of the O2 Academy, and most might know of the Leadmill, but it would be remiss to visit the Steel City without a slow jaunt along the host of quality bars and pubs on the parallel roads of West Street and Division street.

	 

	 

	8) Seville

	An alternative to Barcelona and Madrid, the city promises a great night of discotecas, Tapas, Flamenco, and the devastating Agua de Sevilla – a killer cocktail of four types of liquor, champagne, pineapple juice and cream. Plus you might be able to go along to a Sevilla or Real Betis match if you arrive an hour before kick-off.

	 

	9) Prague

	A tried and tested venue for lads looking for a weekend of fun, Prague is a fascinating smorgasbord of castles and royalty, neo-renaissance museums, strip joints, and hipster multicultural bars and pubs such as the Crossclub and its musical dramaturgy.

	 

	 

	10) Newquay

	Voted “one of the nation’s favourite seaside towns”, Newquay and its beaches represent a great lads’ night out on a super summer evening. Combine surfing, kayaking and other water sports with a host of bars such as the Sailors Arms and Chy Bar.

The 10 Best Things to Do in Brighton, England

	Brighton isn’t a city – it’s an experience. The UK’s most popular seaside resort has a way of capturing people’s hearts and minds, making one‑time visitors into serial Brighton addicts.


	There are a whole range of delights here, from top‑class restaurants to trendy shopping streets, and genteel Victorian architecture to beach‑side beer gardens. But what really sets this place apart is its unique atmosphere.

	Whether it’s discovering a colourful piece of street art, tasting food you’ve never heard of before, or seeing buskers dancing and singing joyfully with tourists, this city will linger with you long after you’ve left.

	So here goes – here are 10 of the absolute best things you can see and do when visiting Brighton.

	 

	1) Visit the Royal Pavilion

	No, it’s not the Taj Mahal. The Royal Pavilion may look like an exotic Indian palace on the outside, but it actually started life as a seaside getaway from British royalty.  

	This impressive palace was created for King George IV, as a luxury retreat where he could indulge his extravagant lifestyle.

	It was built at the height of the British Empire, and furnished with an eclectic mix of Indian and Chinese styles. I’d especially recommend a visit to the Music Room, where lotus­‑shaped chandeliers hang from the ceiling, and painted dragons crawl from floor to ceiling.

	 

	2) Explore Brighton’s independent shops

	Brighton has two main shopping quarters, the Lanes and the North Laine – each with their own special attractions.

	The Lanes is home to many winding alleys, crammed full of little independent boutiques and heavenly cake shops. It’s a fun place to explore, but beware: the narrow old streets here can get crowded, especially in the summer months!

	If you’re after a bargain, or simply a good time, you should also check out the North Laine. There’s a decidedly quirky vibe to this area, and you can find everything here from vintage clothes, to comic books, to ‘vegetarian shoes’ and healing crystals.

	The North Laine might not be as upmarket as the neighbouring Lanes, but it’s as ‘Brighton’ as it gets.

	 

	3) Stay out all night

	Ever since King George IV decided to build his pleasure palace here, Brighton has had – let’s say – a bit of a reputation.

	Nowadays, if you want to let loose and dance the night away, you’ll find a bewildering array of pubs, bars and nightclubs across the city.  

	Many of Brighton’s pubs seem to have been designed exclusively for hipsters, with lots of neon lighting and expensive craft beer. But there are still many hidden gems here, including a pub that has been sculpted to look like a seaside cave, and a bar offering more than 100 types of gin.

	The nightclubs here are also well worth a visit. Brighton’s seaside establishments are adept at pulling down big names from London – and with a big student population to cater to, you’ll find somewhere open late on every night of the week.

	 

	4) Take a seaside stroll

	If you’ve indulged yourself a little too much, there’s nothing better to clear your head than a stroll by the seaside.

	Turn right from the pier towards Hove, and you’ll come across pleasant seafront art galleries, fairground rides and the wonderful Brighton Music Hall, where you can have a beer in the sun while listening to live music.

	Further on, you’ll come to Brighton’s grand Regency squares: first Brunswick, then Palmeira. These rows of tall, cream‑coloured town houses are seriously beautiful, and well‑worth taking the time to see.

	Head in the other direction from the pier, towards Kemptown, to check out the elegant and derelict Madeira Terrace walkway. Eventually you’ll come to Brighton Marina, a great place to stop for a drink or snack by the waterside.

	 

	5) See Brighton from above

	Of course, if you really want to see Brighton in all its glory, the best way to do this is by soaring into the sky on the newly‑built British Airways i360.

	The i360, recognised as the world’s tallest moving observation tower, takes visitors from ground level up to a lofty 138 metres above the city in a glass viewing pod.

	From here, you can marvel at the whole of Brighton and Hove, stretched out beneath you. On a clear day, you’ll also be treated to great views of the English Channel, and the serene white cliffs of the Seven Sisters in the far distance.

	 

	6) Ride on the world’s oldest electric railway

	For those who are afraid of heights, you could always take in the sea air while riding on the world’s oldest electric railway.

	Volk’s Railway was designed by the young entrepreneur Magnus Volk in 1883, and is a splendid piece of Victorian engineering. Riding in one of its handsome and old‑fashioned carriages is the perfect way to connect with Brighton’s past.

	The railway line runs from the Brighton Aquarium all the way to the Marina, and is usually open from around Easter time until the end of October.

	 

	7) Laugh your socks off at a comedy club

	Comedy is a part of Brighton’s identity, just like the famous Pier or a stick of Brighton rock.

	Head to the Komedia club, to see famous names that will have you rolling in the aisles. Or attend one of the city’s open mic nights, where amateur comics battle it out to tickle your funny bone.

	Either way, Brighton’s comedy shows will definitely leave you with a smile on your face!

	 

	8) Go vegetarian for the day

	If there’s anywhere that can convince you to go meat‑free, it’s Brighton.

	You’ll find vegetarian restaurants of all shapes and sizes here, ranging from fine dining establishments to bustling cafes. What’s more, the chefs here are constantly coming up with new ways to get you to eat your greens.

	There’s vegan pizza, vegan tapas – and for those who want to enjoy the full seaside experience, you can even try a plant‑based version of fish n’ chips!

	 

	9) Wander down London Road 

	London Road used one of the city’s most run‑down neighbourhoods, but recent years have seen a transformation take place.

	New shops and restaurants have sprung up, bringing life and colour to this inner‑city district. The newly‑built Open Market hosts a thriving community of traders, as well as a number of artists’ studios.

	The area also boasts some of the city’s best pubs – including the World’s End with its retro gaming arcade, and the Hobgoblin, home to one of Brighton’s biggest and best beer gardens.

	 

	10) Join in the fun at one of Brighton’s many festivals

	Brighton’s calendar is packed full of annual festivals that bring joy and colour to the city.

	The best time to visit is in May during Brighton Festival, the UK’s second largest arts festival after Edinburgh.

	Also happening in May are the Brighton Fringe festival, the Great Escape music festival, and the Artist’s Open Houses events – weekends where hundreds of artists across Brighton open their houses and studios to curious visitors.

	Finally, visit later in the summer for Brighton’s world‑famous gay pride celebration. This colourful, vibrant event is enjoyed by residents and visitors of all persuasions, and soaking up the atmosphere here will definitely restore your faith in humanity.

	 

	So, there you have it – 10 of the best things you can do on a visit to Brighton. From shopping to festival‑going, pub­‑hopping to fine dining, culture to comedy, this really is one of the best destinations in the UK to have a good time.

	But don’t take my word for it. Visit Brighton for yourself, and find out why so many people are in love with this city by the sea.

The Best Surf Spots to Visit Down Under

	If you’re looking to catch a few waves in Australia this summer, your choices are virtually endless. With a string of islands down the east of the country all offering incredible beaches, not to mention the island of Tasmania at the foot of the country, Australia is well known for having some of the most incredible beaches in the world. The problem is that you’re now spoiled for choice – if you haven’t been to Australia yet to try these beaches for yourself, how do you know where to start? Fortunately we’re here to help you get your bearings on the best beaches in Australia. Go you’re your wetsuit and get your board waxed – here are the best surf spots to visit down under.


	 

	Marrawah, Tasmania

	If you’re looking to get a load of surfing in and not a lot else, Marrawah in Tasmania may just be the choice for you. There are some great waves to be had, but because it’s just home to one little fishing town in the middle of nowhere, you can avoid the touristy crowds that you’d get at some of Australia’s other surf beaches.

	 

	Catherine Hill Bay, New South Wales

	Moving northeast to the Sydney area, Catherine Hill Bay is slightly more touristy, but not to the level of Sydney proper. Catherine Hill Bay is home to a little mining village and some impressive barrels you can ride just off the coast. 

	 

	Agnes Waters, Queensland

	Despite Agnes Waters being routinely listed as one of Australia’s top 10 beaches, this Queensland beach still isn’t massively touristy. It is, however, the last surfing beach you can visit in the north of the country before you hit the Great Barrier Reef. If you’re keen on stopping by Agnes Beach and catching a few waves, grab yourself a tent and some friends and head on down. If your friends can’t surf yet, drop them off at the local surf school before going and pulling your wetsuit on.

	https://www.wetsuitcentre.co.uk/wetsuits.html

	 

	Bells Beach, Victoria

	We’re now at the one of the most popular surf beaches in Australia, Bells Beach. This beach in Victoria is actually home to the Australia’s oldest professional surf competition, the Rip Curl Pro. If you aren’t already an advanced surfer, this beach may be a little harsh – the waves here can reach as high as 5m on a fairly regular basis. If you’re not ready to try the waves for yourself just yet, there’s always a wave of surfers on the water that you can test your photography skills on.

	 

	Margaret River, Western Australia

	Margaret River is possibly one of the most advanced surf beaches in the world, let alone Australia. This beach is simply a clump of billion-year-old limestone which juts out into the raw ocean, with a string of extremely fine soft white sand to walk along when you’re not in the water. With regular 6m waves forming the perfect barrels to ride though, it’s quite surprising if you make your way here and don’t get in the water. On that note, it’s little surprise that this beach is so popular with some of the world’s greatest professional surfers. If Bells Beach was too advanced for you though, Margaret River is certainly not going to encourage you to get out on the water. These waves are perfect for the highly advanced rider, but they’re not for the faint of heart!

The Best Tourist Sites to Visit in Oslo 

	Norway’s capital, Oslo, is a city unlike any other; a cosmopolitan hub buzzing with energy which still manages to stay close to nature. With plenty of museums, stunning architecture, cutting-edge food, and an established fashion and art scene, it should definitely be on your travel bucket list. 


	Oslo’s compact city centre makes it ideal for exploring by bike or on foot, and its efficient public transport system means you’ll have no problem getting to all the best sites.

	Here are the best places you should add to your Oslo travel itinerary:

	 

	1. Vigeland Sculpture Park (Vigelandsparken)

	

	Situated within Frogner Park, this sculpture park is the largest in the world made by a single artist. With more than 200 sculptures by Gustav Vigeland in bronze, cast iron, and granite, the collection is undoubtedly impressive. 

	Although the type of statues on display vary greatly, they are all naked. Vigeland wished to emphasize that they could “be anyone, anywhere, at any time”, and felt no desire to define traits such as religion or nationality. On a nice day, this becomes the go-to picnic spot for locals and tourists alike. 

	 

	2. Holmenkollen Ski Museum & Ski Jump

	

	The Holmenkollen neighbourhood is located on a hill on the Northwestern side of the city at 375 metres above sea level. It’s easily accessed by subway and offers excellent views over Oslo. 

	The Ski Museum is underneath the famous ski jump and presents over 4.000 years of skiing history. It also showcases an extensive collection of Norwegian polar exploration artefacts, as well as a modern skiing and snowboarding exhibition. 

	Head to the observation deck on top of the jump for panoramic views over the city, which are particularly spectacular at night. 

	 

	3. National Opera House (Operahuset)

	

	Just 500 metres from the central station (Oslo S), this architectural masterpiece is considered to be the pride of the city. Sitting at the water’s edge in the harbour, it has an angled, white exterior with large-scale windows which allow a glimpse inside. In fact, it looks like the building is mysteriously rising up from the water. 

	There is a restaurant in the lobby and visitors are encouraged to take a stroll on the roof, which offers great views over the city as well as the Oslo fjord. 

	 

	3. The Viking Ship Museum (Vikingskipshuset)

	For a true Viking Age experience, head to the Viking Ship Museum on the Bygdøy peninsula. It’s home to the world’s best preserved Viking ships and showcases artefacts found in Viking tombs around the Oslo fjord.

	You can also explore discoveries from the Gokstad, Oseberg, and Tune ships, as well as a variety of items such as small boats, tools, and eating utensils. As a bonus, you can use your ticket to enter the Historical Museum for free within 24 hours of your visit.  

	 

	4. Akershus Fortress (Akershus Festning)

	

	Rising above the city on a hill, visit the Akershus Fortress and Castle to discover some of Oslo’s rich history and enjoy a nice walk with great views. Guided tours are available during the summer. 

	Its history dates back to 1299 and was commenced under King Håkon V. It was modernised in the 17th century under the rule of King Christian IV and turned into a Renaissance palace, but the front still remains medieval. 

	 

	5. Norsk Folkemuseum 

	Vsit one of the world’s oldest and largest open-air museums to experience Norway’s rich cultural history. Also on the Bygdøy peninsula, the Norsk Folkemuseum features real-sized historical buildings which represent the different regions of the country. 

	Staff are dressed in traditional clothes from various time periods and demonstrate activities such as brewing beer and baking lefse with plenty of storytelling. It’s one of the best places to see a traditional Stavkirke, a medieval wooden Christian church dating back to the year 1200. 

	There are also indoor exhibitions featuring traditional handicraft items, folk costumes, and pharmaceutical history. In the summer, they offer extra activities such as feeding animals and horse and carriage rides.   

	 

	6. National Gallery (Nasjonalmuseet)

	Established in 1837, Oslo’s National Museum houses the largest collection of paintings, drawings, and sculptures in Norway. Its permanent collection features some of Edvard Munch’s most famous paintings, including “Scream”, and they also have impressive temporary collections. 

	As well as national artists, you can take in pieces by famous European artists such as Gauguin, Picasso, and Manet. For an enchanting experience, head to the Fairy Tale Room which features art depicting princesses, trolls, and other magical creatures. 

	 

	7. TusenFryd Amusement Park

	The park is open from mid April through to September and located 30 minutes south of Oslo, so if you fancy doing something different, hop on a bus and spend the day having fun. 

	TusenFryd is Norway’s largest amusement park, and with over 30 attractions which cater to all ages, there’s something for everyone. Entrance also includes access to a small water park.

The Ultimate Australia Packing List


	 

	 

	Australia is known for its vast and wild adventure that draws people from as far as North America, Europe and other parts of the world. As a rule, whenever one is traveling abroad, there are dos and don’ts one should familiarize with to avoid unnecessary disappointments. Knowing to speak what is the most spoken language in the world is good but learning local dialects and slang words is more substantial as it can ease your stay abroad. When packing your stuff, some things are a must-have in your bag to enhance your adventure. For this reason, this article will delve into some essentials one should carry when going on a trip to Australia.

	 

	
		Carry enough drinks 


	If you love liquors, it is a good thing to stock enough of them in your backpack as it is costly to buy drinks in bars. If you are on a shoestring budget, you can drink some for topping up in a bar. Alternatively, make a budgetary provision of the same to avoid spending money that is meant for other things.

	
		Don’t forget to include a dictionary – Australian into American


	You must be wondering why carrying an Australian dictionary when visiting this country is recommended. The main reason is that even though English is the official language, there are local dialects that may make communication difficult.

	 

	Having this dictionary will come in handy as some common words may mean different things in Australia. For instance, “bum bag” is how they call a fanny pack, “capsicums” means peppers, “ketchup” stands for tomato sauce, “chips” for fries, “car boot” means trunk, “car bonnet” – a hood, say “fortnight” to indicate period after two weeks, and say “gas” if you need some petrol.

	 

	Nothing can be as disappointing as referring to something you know too well only for your friends to look surprised. In Australia for example, rooting which is cheering or supporting a side there means having sex and the city center means central business district (CBD) Some shortened words may also be confusing and mean something else i.e., “bickies” stands for biscuits, and arvo, which is a short name for afternoon, may be confused with avocado. You may not see much sense in what I am saying now, but when you arrive there, you will see the confusion some of these words can cause.

	 

	
		Carry sun-blocks and hydro flasks


	 

	If you haven’t been in this country before, then carry sun-blocks to protect your skin and if possible, try staying balance in the shadows longer. Your eyes too should be well protected with sunglasses and ensure your body is well hydrated as the excessive heat from the sun may cause sunburns if you don’t.

	

	Instead of buying packed water, you can carry a refillable hydro flask which can be refilled with tap water. Not that the sun there is different from the one in other parts of the world, but due to its thinner Ozone layer, it makes surfaces to heat up much easier. In fact, South Eastern Queensland has the highest cancer prevalence in Australia. Consequently, if you have pale skin, ensure it is not exposed to direct sunlight.

	
		Pack a swimsuit and some popcorn to eat as you watch games


	In other parts of the world like Europe, football is glorified, but things are different in Australia as rugby is the most preferred game. And those who don’t like it, opt for other sports such as swimming. During your vacation, you will find several interesting hobbies to engage in as a way of killing time.

	If you are planning your visit during the games season, why not buy some popcorn to enjoy your games as you watch?  Or head to the ocean to have a taste of how swimming is like there but swimmers must be cautious as most waters there are shark invested and to avoid being attacked, you should only swim between flags meant for protecting swimmers from water swells which may bring sharks with them during tides.

	
		Carry your passport as you head to the airport


	Nationals from other parts of the world except New Zealand can only visit Australia if they have a visa.  If you are from Canada, US, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, South Korea and Brunei, you can apply for a Visa online through the official visa application page and then wait for about two days for its approval.

	 

	Approval notifications are made via email address and once approved, only a passport is required at the airport as the systems are computerized, and if you are not from the above countries, liaise with your local embassy to know your country’s visa requirements or instead contract professional custom essay writing service to get a comprehensive information on your nation’s requirements.

	 

	The given Visa is not a permit for searching jobs abroad as visa applicants can only remain there for three months a year, but if you are intending to look for a job, then you should apply for a work permit.

	

	
		A camera to capture beautiful moments


	Camera is one of the most basic things one should carry when going for an adventure. If you don’t have one, you can use your smart phone’s camera but ensure it has a good resolution to take nice shots. When going around, you will see wild animals as there are plenty of them in the parks and you will only have yourself to blame if you fail to capture those beautiful moments for failing to carry one.

	
		Remember to carry an unlocked phone


	There is a poor Internet connection and network coverage in Australia, but you can get free Wi-Fi in major hotels in places like McDonald’s. For this reason, you should invest in a good Wi-Fi router to create the Internet signal for your devices, or you can unlock your phone to accept Tesla SIM card – Tesla has the best network coverage here, but if you don’t do any of those, you will remain offline throughout.

The Ultimate Guide to Planning a School Trip 

	Taking the plunge and organising a school trip can be a very daunting process from start to finish. However, if you do your research and take advice from experts, there is no reason why your next school trip shouldn’t be enjoyable for both you and your pupils. Read on to discover some useful considerations that will make your planning as stress-free and efficient as possible.


	 

	 

	1. Choose Your Destination

	Ensure that you choose a location which provides many activities for your students and enriches them on knowledge to give them the best experience possible.

	 

	 

	2. Contact The Experts

	Of course, you will never be expected to plan a school trip on your own from scratch. There is far too much to consider in terms of location, costs, safety, activities, and so on. The best option to take when planning a school trip is to get in contact with student travel companies who will take a lot of the work off your hands. These companies are specifically designed to offer you a variety of school trip options, taking your needs and preferences into consideration.

	Once you are in touch with a travel company, the next task will be deciding what location to head to. 

	 

	 

	3. Organisation

	To stay organised throughout the whole process, keep timelines and checklists so that you don’t end up forgetting important tasks. A lot goes in to the creating of a school trip and it is essential that the process is as straightforward and controlled as possible. The last thing you want is unhappy students! Note down all important details and keep documents in safe places. Time chunk your tasks and keep a diary of important dates.

	 

	 

	4. Risk Assessments

	As you will be supervising a large amount of students, carrying out risk assessments is a vital part in the planning of a school trip. Ensure that you have covered all risk possibilities in the following areas:

	
		Accommodation
	
		Transport
	
		Excursions


	The concept of a risk assessment is pretty simple. If someone is in danger, then a risk assessment is necessary in order to ensure that unfortunate events are unlikely to take place. The main goal is to ensure that all students (and yourself) get home safe and sound. Be sure to take these factors into heavy consideration:

	
		• Someone identifying a hazard
	
		• Putting judgement on the severity of harm that may be encountered
	
		• Putting in place necessary control measures to rectify the problem


	 

	 

	5. Promote

	Once everything is settled and the trip is in the calendar, you’ll need to promote your trip. This often gets ignored when planning an excursion, but it is very important! Get the buzz going around your students with posters and itineraries.

	 

	 

	6. Enjoy

	Lastly, just make sure that you have a good time! This trip should be just as enjoyable for you as it is for the students!

Thinking about teaching English in Italy?
Advice for Teaching English in Rome, Italy.. Take a course and start a teaching job in Rome....

1. Be prepared to fight for your place in line for gelato: No one can resist the allure of sweet and creamy homemade gelato, and Rome’s is not to be missed. With flavors ranging from the fruity pesca (peach), pera (pear) or fragola (strawberry) to the sweet stracciatella (chocolate chip) and zenzero e cannella (ginger and cinnamon) locals shamelessly crowd their neighborhood 'gelaterie' to get their daily sugar fix. Assert your right for indulging in this delectable dessert, and fight through the mob by repeating scusate (excuse me). You will be asked "Panna?" when your order is being completed - this is the offer of whipped cream on top.
2. Buy wine, not water or soda:  Cheaper than bottled water or a can of cola, it’s often the most economical choice when you’re buying from street vendors. Besides, having a glass of wine or two with lunch is perfectly acceptable in Italy, a country that is home to some of the oldest wine producing regions in the world.
3. There’s a 'prego' for every occasion: This snippet of the Italian vernacular fits a number of contexts at all times of day, meaning everything from ‘how can I help you?’ to ‘you’re welcome.’ A favorite of everyone from pastry store owners to cleaning ladies, it can even be heard as an utterance meaning ‘I pray’- in which case you might catch it walking into a cluttered room or slow-moving pack of tourists.
4. Camp out at Campo de' Fiori: Located in the heart of the city, there is no better market in Rome than the jumble of shops set up outdoors in the Campo de’ Fiori. Pre-dinner drinks (aperitivi) accompanied with small hors d'oeuvres (antipasti) are enjoyed in the open air by Rome’s student set, surrounded by mouth-watering displays of fresh fruit and vegetables.
5. Care for your coffee: In Italy, a latte is simply a glass of milk. If you’d like coffee in your glass as well, order a caffe latte. A latte macchiato (meaning "marked") is steamed milk with a small shot of espresso. Espresso doppio means a double shot of espresso. Be warned, however, that no one in Rome drinks coffee past 11 am (by then they are onto their first glass of Chianti.)

Top 10 Reasons to Volunteer in Costa Rica

	In 2017 Abi Phillips travelled through Central America and into Costa Rica to volunteer for 2 months on the Caribbean coast near the Tortuguero national park. Abi had always been interested in volunteering, conservation and nature and so she joined a turtle conservation project called La Tortuga Feliz which turned out to be the best experience of her life. Here she shares her experience and top 10 reasons why volunteering in Costa Rica is awesome.


	Here she shares her experience and top 10 reasons why volunteering in Costa Rica is awesome.

	 

	1.Biodiverstiy

	Rich in biodiversity, a top game player in eco-tourism and ecological research facilities, Costa Rica is a prime location for any sort of volunteer experience. Any hostel I visited I was sure to meet someone who had either finished up an amazing volunteer programme or was working on some exciting monkey or plant study. Everyone is on the nature vibe, climbing volcanos, venturing ancient jungles and immersing themselves in the green belt.

	 

	2. Techno Debunk

	One of my favourite things about my experience volunteering with turtles in Costa Rica was the technology debunk! Sure, if you want you can bring with you a solar charger and spend a while soaking up the sun’s rays to send a few texts home (depending on power facilities). But when do you ever have the experience now days to spend time completely technologically isolated, with no phone attached to you. I felt cleansed, mindful and far more social without any technology and what we think to be modern necessities!

	 

	3.Turtles, Turtles, Turtles

	With 4 species of turtles visiting the beach during the night over several busy months of the year. You will see at least one turtle at the bare minimum and it will be awesome. Perhaps under a full moon, a sky of stars or a tropical thunderstorm you will see her crawl out of the sea and lay her eggs right in front of you. A truly dreamlike experience that little can compare. Learning how to care, protect and support these giant prehistoric creatures is an understanding that you will never forget.

	 

	4. People

	Meeting people was super exhilarating. Due to the nature of the place and the reasons why each person has chosen to come, you instantly have a connection with everyone there so it’s easy to go alone and have a little family the next day. I travelled here alone and left with close friends from all over the world of all ages and stages. Everyone shares such a passion and love for nature, conservation and the environment, its magical!

	 

	5. Biology

	Knowledge about conservation and Biology. These.people.know.their.stuff.  Not only is there an immense wealth of knowledge held by the local guides but everyone arranging the walks, hatchery, station and grounds is either a biologist or studying to be one or something similar. I learnt so much about not only conservation here in Costa Rica but all over the world. My knowledge of biology, ecosystems and ecology grew 10-fold and I left feeling like I had just been to the most thrilling school ever. 

	 

	6. Travel

	Right smack in the middle of Americas, Costa Rica is the perfect location to not only volunteer but use as a travel base before and after volunteering. Neighbouring countries such as Nicaragua to the north or Panama to the southern border are equally incredible travel destinations. Travelling through Costa Rica was like taking a deep breath of fresh air and relaxing a little bit as out of all of the Central American countries I would say this is the safest. It has an awesome, established hostel environment, great and easy bus system, an established international airport offering affordable flights, good roads and great professional tourism. Check out Costa Rica tours

	 

	7. Local Culture / Practise Spanish

	I would recommend practising some basic Spanish before coming to learn as much as you can from the local guides! Duolingo is perfect for this. Its super easy to pick up basic words and is a fun easy app to use. You can also book a Spanish course in Costa Rica. The Costa Rican people are warm, funny and friendly! The local guides who help with guiding for night walks rule that beach! They are turtle whisperers at heart and the ocean is in their soul. If you can get to know them, throw around a few jokes and listen to their honeypot of turtle knowledge you will come away with a beyond valuable experience. Food is fantastic, Costa Rican culture and crafts are colourful, beautiful and exciting. Pura Vida!

	 

	8. Baby Turtles

	And what comes with mama turtles is baby turtles. Releasing newly hatched turtles into a glowing pink and red sunset has to be one of life’s greatest experiences. So much life moving out into the sea, and you have helped to save each and every one of them. Waiting all hunched over a nest for the first sand to cave in as a rare species of hawksbill emerges for their first real breath is one of those unforgettable moments.  

	 

	9. Read, Relax, Recover

	Yup, you will be busy and you will be tired at times but you will also have some great down time, so bring an awesome book or just relax in a hammock and watch the lizards scuttle around. Get in touch with yourself and take in the sea breeze! Being here is a great time to unwind, connect to nature and be away from any life stresses or the business of being! Being in touch with nature so closely is a unique moment to make relaxing an easier process.

	 

	10. Natural Wonderland

	It’s hard to count how many animals I saw in Costa Rica. Lizards of all types were abundant, trails of ants to step over and monkeys moving about in the trees overhead. Thousands and thousands of unique species of plants, flowers in abundance for the butterflies and trees towering over like skyscrapers. If you are a super nature enthusiast I would recommend bringing a bird, bug or plant field guide as it’s fun to try identify your favourites.

	 

	I would go back to Costa Rica to volunteer in a heartbeat and to visit again all the baby turtles who come back to their place of nesting to lay their own eggs. When you help one species it creates a network of life that filters into more and more environments so get volunteering and who knows what your change will bring.

Top Ideas What to Do During a Gap Year Before Medical School

	Are you wondering how should you spend your medical gap year? Need ideas for how to spend time before going to medical school? For many a gap year isn’t planned. The fierce competitive nature of applying to medical school means that many are left with no other option but to take a year out and reapply the following year. After the initial disappointment of not getting into med school at the first attempt, embrace your gap year, it may just be the best thing you ever do. 


	The reality is that getting into med school isn’t easy. UK based medical schools are so over subscribed that there’s a good chance prospective medical students will have to take a gap year if unsuccessful and reapply the following year. Prospective medical school students are generally very focused in their desire to succeed in their chosen discipline. Medicine for many is a vocation, if an applicant finds themself unsuccessful in applying for medical school the first time many will take time to improve their applications for the next year. This also shows the medical schools that you will be applying to, that you have the dedication needed to succeed in your career and that you wont be deterred by failing to get a place at the first attempt.

	An applicant that can pick themselves up from a setback like not be accepted the first time and come back with a stronger application the second time around is demonstrating a resolve that can only be looked upon favourably. Many see an imposed gap year as a bad thing but a year out of education before embarking on a long and tough medical degree isn’t necessarily a bad thing. People looking back on their imposed gap year are thankful of it and in many cases if used correctly it can be of great benefit to your future medical career. For many also it is a time to take stock. A career in medicine should not be entered into frivolously and many medical gap year students will use the extra experience gained during their gap year to reaffirm their decision to enter into the world of medicine.

	 

	 

	5 Useful Ways to Spend a Medical Gap Year

	 

	Get some medical work experience

	Show the medical school admissions staff that you used your gap year wisely, get some valuable experience in your chosen field either in the UK or abroad to show a willingness to learn and a commitment to medicine.

	 

	Go traveling

	See the world, enjoy different cultures, you will come back a more mature person for exploring the world and can help you prepare for living away during university.

	 

	Polish that personal statement and your interview skills

	You have a year off so practise practise and practise some more for those all important medical school interviews and applications.

	 

	Work & Earn some money!

	Medical school certainly isn’t cheap and working for a year will certainly help you combat these costs and allow you to do more when at university!

	 

	Combine all four!

	Work for a few months, volunteer on weekends, save up, go traveling, turn it into a medical gap year and when you come back you’ll find the UCAS form isn’t big enough to list all you have done in your medical gap year!

	 

	However you choose to spend your medical gap year be sure to make it useful. The worst thing you can do on a gap year, especially if the reason for taking one is rejections from medical school, is to stagnate, not improving your chances of entry the following year. As med school places become even more at a premium you may just find yourself joining the ranks of the growing number of impromptu medical gap year students, relish the opportunity to fill your year with medical experience, your application will look too good to overlook next year and it might just be the best thing you ever do.

	Companies like Gap Medics, Work the World, Projects Abroad and Volunteering Solutons offers pre-university medical and nursing work experience placements to help you on your way to a career in healthcare.

	Anyone who has been to summer camp will vouch that it’s one of the best jobs you’ll ever have. You get to spend all summer being a big kid, meeting like-minded people, teaching something you love.

Top Tips for Solo Backpackers in Asia

	Are you planning to go backpacking solo around Asia? This can be one of the most amazing experiences on your life but there are lots of things you might not know if you have never done anything like this before. If you are looking to travel solo abroad we have put together some useful advice which should be able to help you plan a trip and make the most of the experience. Below you will be able to read information about how to plan a trip, safety advice, tips for meeting people and enjoying the best time possible.


	Before Departing

	
		Research destinations before departing by viewing websites and buying guide books
		 
	
		Think about booking group activities like volunteer projects in Asia, these will mean you travel in a structured trip and will not be alone
		 
	
		Try to put together a rough itinerary, know what to see, how to reach those places, where to stay, make budget plan
		 
	
		Check forums, websites and facebook pages for country information and latest travel news
		 
	
		Buy a guidebook to take with you to research destinations and places you would like to visit
		 
	
		Consider paying a little extra and join overland tours in Asia, this will be a lot more relaxed as you will be guided to all destinations


	 

	 

	When Abroad

	
		Research its good to know where&#39;s considered the "bad" part of town (even if its not really)
		 
	
		Connect with locals and other travellers as much as you can
		 
	
		Carry a first aid kit
		 
	
		Learn local basic phrases like hi, please, where, and thank you
		 
	
		Find local excursions and trips where you will meet other internationals


	 

	 

	Meeting New People

	
		A lot of places have free wifi and internet especially in Thailand for example, but don&#39;t get stuck in front of your computer this might put people off mixing with you
		 
	
		Get talking everywhere you go, no traveler is ever alone just use your gut instinct on who is nice / not
		 
	
		You meet the most people at hostels / dorms so don&#39;t be afraid to make friends anywhere and everywhere. Some people might not turn out to be best friends with you but it might help during that part of a trip
		 
	
		Be open and curious - you&#39;ll meet more people, have more immersive experiences & do things that others haven&#39;t
		 
	
		Stay in shared / dorm accommodation


	 

	 

	Safety Advice

	
		Check a countries safety advice on a official website source, some countries like Cambodia and China might sound scary but in reality they are very safe to visit
		 
	
		Be your own best counsel - if it doesn&#39;t feel right, don&#39;t do it
		 
	
		Have the courage to talk to others and try to make friends to travel with
		 
	
		Know and respect culture around, and follow ur instinct, if something feels too good to be true it probably is
		 
	
		If you ever feel uneasy / bad about a situation try to get away
		 
	
		Ask fellow travellers for their experiences and destination advice
		 
	
		Remember not everyone wants to harm you, but not everyone wants to be your best friend
		 
	
		Look confident and try not to dont dress like a tourist, try to pass for a local if possible (reading a local paper might be going a little to far though)
		 
	
		Create a site plan for the city and have a good map prior to starting out. Stay at a hostel / hotel in a city center


	
	These are just a few of our suggestions which will hopefully help you plana  trip abroad. The world is an amazing place and you can have a great time exploring it solo.

Varna Travel Guide

	Bulgaria is grossly overlooked, and nowhere within Bulgaria is more overlooked than Varna. This coastal city is within close range of Sophia (Bulgaria’s Capital) and of Sunny Beach, Bulgaria’s tourism hotspot. View our travel g


	 

	Getting there:

	I travelled to Varna on a last-minute Thomas Cook booking which because I was flying solo, was very cheap. There are always cancellations or free seats on planes so you should always try and be spontaneous when booking your flights, my flight from Manchester (England) to Varna (Bulgaria) was £58 pounds, without a return of course.

	 

	Currency

	Once you are in Bulgaria you’ll instantly start to question the cost of things. I exchanged my money in England and got 100 Bulgarian Lev for roughly 48 pounds meaning 2 Lev is near enough equal to 1 pound. Bulgaria is scarily cheap in a lot of ways, you can buy a 2-litre bottle of Beer here for 2 lev, eating out costs about the same if you stay outside of the inner city and even then the prices for a meal don’t get anywhere near 10 lev, which is a fiver. If you played it smart you could live in Varna for a long time on a very small budget. I have been getting around the city using mainly busses, which no matter where you’re getting off, are One Lev. I have been staying in a small apartment complex in the less commercial part of the city and so getting the bus is a must to reach any of the amazing places in Varna. 

	 

	The Malls (There are three, but the Grand Mall is the best, for now)

	In the centre of Varna is the Grand Mall, which has everything that you could want, including an IMAX cinema which by the way only plays their films in English, unless it’s an animation. Beware of the fact that other languages won’t be translated for you, for example I went to see Skyscraper in IMAX and because its set in Hong Kong there were obviously Chinese speaking characters, they only provide the subtitles for such scenes in Bulgarian. So, don’t go and watch something like Loving Pablo, or Sicario: Soldado because they are likely to have Colombian or Spanish speaking characters and you’ll be at a loss, unless of course you speak those languages. The mall also has an arcade, millions of clothing outlets and a few games shops. There book shop has an English section with most of the popular books there so if you’ve run out of reading material its worth having a look there.

	 

	Sea side and night times

	The sea in Varna is beautiful, I recently went to Antalya in Turkey to find the beach was mostly rocks or boulders if you would. Varna is clear sands and clear seas though be careful when getting in. A quick story, I’m not really scared of anything in life okay, but somethings, I just can’t be doing with that. So, I went into the sea for a swin, and noticed a lot of sea weed, some old ladies were walking around with it on their faces and shoulders for its apparent healing properties but I just thought they looked like Scooby-Doo villains. So, I’m swimming and the seaweed begins to feel, weird. It was Jellyfish, hundreds upon hundreds of tiny or sometimes not so tiny, jellyfish. I hate Jellyfish. They are not harmful or anything but it took me a long time to get back in the water, they did eventually leave though.

	Next to the sea is the Sea Garden, a lovely rural area filled with constant activities, when I walked around there was a small group of people giving lessons on traditional Bulgarian dances. The next time there was a group of people teaching breakdancing. However, it is at night time when Varna really comes to life. All down the main streets and the sea garden are jugglers, musicians, magicians and dancers. Bright colours and good ice cream. Night time is when Varna really thrives and if you’re with friends or on your own you really feel part of the community.

	 

	Other:

	Other activities include Shooting ranges which are around 7 Lev for ten shots and swimming pools, he public ones are nice and are very cheap. Better take your sandals though. In my time here, I also visited NesseBar which is quite a large tourist attraction for its 12th and 13th century buildings, it’s a beautiful sea side town with some amazing views and places to eat.

Volunteer in Borneo


	
		
	
		Volunteer in Borneo
	
		Apply to become a volunteer on the spectacular island of Borneo and get ready for the most amazing experience of your life! Borneo is an exotic location to volunteer, this is the third largest island in the world home to some of the most stunning and endangered wildlife on the planet. Borneo is famous for its wildlife including orang-utans, sea turtles and bears - all of which are facing a difficult future. Due to humans the natural habitat of orang-utans is dissapearing at an alarming rate but as a volunteer you will be able to help these creatures, and other animals, as well as playing a key role in help with education and awareness. Most programs are run in the Malaysian state of Sabah and Sepilok. Applying to volunteer in Borneo will be one of the most amazing things you can do in your life, there are various conservation projects with animals and also community development initiatives available to join all year round. View our guide to volunteering in Borneo and apply for a life changing experience today.
	
		 
	
		 
	
		Top Reasons to Volunteer in Borneo
	
		
			Not many places in the world compare to this island - pictures do not do it justice
		
			There are so many animal species which are unique to this region
		
			The beaches and nature is incredible - this island will leave you in awe
		
			You will get to meet new people from all around the world - this is one of the most popular volunteer destinations in Asia
		
			By applying you will immerse yourself in the local culture and communities mixing with local people and learning about their traditions
	
	
		 
	
		 
	
		
	
		Wildlife Volunteer Projects in Borneo
	
		Most volunteering opportunities have a focus on wildlife and conservation, there are some of the most worthwhile projects in the world currently being operated here with various wildlife sanctuaries and outreach initiatives doing some inspiring work with orang-utans and other animals. At the moment wildlife natural habitats are being destroyed at an alarming rate partly due to palm oil plantations which means animals in this region face an uncertain future. A lot of animals are also killed by poachers and this results in many orphaned babies which need to be cared for by humans. There are projects where you can help sun bears, these are the smallest bear species which are only found in Asia. In Sepilok there is the Bornean Sun Bear Conservation centre which help sun bears with the ultimate aim of releasing them back into the wild. You could also be helping proboscis and other species of monkeys and pigmy elephants. Duties can include working in teams with local staff, collecting food, cleaning enclosures and helping with with general rehabilitation. You will also be able to help educate the local population about the need for conservation and there are also skilled placements available if you are seeking vetinary work experience.
	
		 
	
		 
	
		
	
		Volunteer with Orang-utans in Borneo
	
		Due to de-forestation orang-utans are facing an uncertain future in the wild but lots of inspiration work is being done in places like the world famous Sepilok Orang-utan Rehabilitation Centre to protect the wildlife and give them medical attention if they are injured. There are daily tours and educational talks where you can learn more about the animals and efforts being made to protect them. Working with orang-utans in Borneo is one of the most popular programs we offer on our website. Orangutans in Borneo are unfortunately very endangered and participating on these programs will be an unforgettable experience. Helping at an orangutan sanctuary is amazing, you will be able to see first hand the work being done to help and protect orang-utans which have been injured and rescued. Most programs have a focus on preservation and rehabilitation, these are wild animals (not pets) and you might be restricted to participating and helping from a distance. This is because places like the Sepilok Centre in Borneo want the orang-utans to live in a &#39;normal&#39; environment as possible whilst restricting hands on contact also reduces the chances of humans passing on illness/disease. Also on a lot of projects you won&#39;t get hands on contact, usually full time local staff will be the only people who get to feed the orang-utans.
	
		 
	
		 
	
		
	
		Volunteer with Sea Turtles in Borneo
	
		There are several sea turtle projects available to join in Borneo - you will get to live close to the ocean in a spectacular setting. Selingan Island is a remote and spectacular destination where turtles lay their eggs on the beaches. Lots of work is being done here to help protect the turtle eggs from poachers, you can visit and stay on the island or volunteer to help conservation efforts too. There are real problems with turtle poaching in South-East Asia and eggs are still openly sold in markets. More work needs to be done on educating the local population and getting them involved in conservation programs and you can play a role in helping.This island is one of the true paradises of the world, the ocean is crystal clear whilst the beaches very clean compared to others in South-East Asia.
	
		 
	
		 
	
		
	
		Environmental and Conservation Projects
	
		Borneo is a really beautiful island - probably like nowhere you will ever visit in your life. There are lots of local and international charities and organisations operating conservation projects in Borneo. The rainforests here are the oldest in the world at 130 million years old and home to so many exotic plants and animals which need protecting. Some projects are marine based and work to help giant clams and coral reefs, you will work alongside local staff monitoring the ocean, helping biodiversity and informing local communities and school children about the environment which needs to be protected.
	
		 
	
		 
	
		Community Development
	
		There are some really rewarding community and volunteer teaching programs available to join. Even though Borneo is a luxury destination it might shock you to realise there is very real poverty within local communities. Borneo is also home to 30 different ethnic groups, including the Kelabits, Penan, Dayaks, Dunsun, Murut and Kadayan and international charities and local NGO&#39;s have lots of initiatives operating to help improve the living conditions for rural communities and they accept international volunteers to help. There are also projects where you can help indigenous communities with the aim of preserving their traditions and cultures.
	
		 
	
		 
	
		
	
		Teach in Borneo
	
		It is estimated that around 20% of children in Sabah have never been to school and have never had a formal education. If you apply to teach in Borneo you will get to work helping school children improve their English writing and speaking skills. These placements are a lot of fun and you will usually get to help with coaching sports and other activities too. Local teachers will be very helpful for the duration of your stay and you will learn a lot of new skills, if you are looking for a rewarding way to volunteer and help people - we can&#39;t recommend these placements highly enough.
	
		 
	
		 
	
		
	
		How to Apply
	
		There are summer and year round placements available which can be booked in advance through our website. If you have certain dates in mind you will need to enquire well ahead to secure a spot. You can search our featured projects and register your interest, ask a question or apply today. Most organisations offer structured volunteering placements in Borneo where you will need to pay a fee to join.
	
		This usually includes:
	
		
			Placements and pre-departure information
		
			Training
		
			Airport transfers
		
			Shared accommodation
		
			3 meals daily
		
			In-country support
	
	
		 
	
		 
	
		
			How to Volunteer in Borneo for Free
		
			To volunteer for free in Borneo you will need to apply with a local NGO, sometimes you will still need to cover your accommodation and food though. Volunteering in Borneo for free or no cost can be difficult - this is an off the beaten track destination and most of the projects here need funding from donations and volunteers. Finding free volunteer projects with orangutans is nearly immpossible due to the complications with arranging placements and the need for donations to help with conservation efforts. If you are skilled proffessional e.g. doctor, architect, vet then you might be able to apply to join a paid / free placement as skilled workers are desperately needed to help people and improve facilities.
		
			 
		
			 
		
			Booking Help
		
			If you need any help booking a tour or volunteering program in Borneo please get in touch.

WAVA launches 'School Gap Year Volunteering Groups' programme
WAVA recently launched a new gap year group volunteering programme for 16 to 17 year old school students who want to travel and volunteer... Maybe WAVA have taken leave of our senses, but after a considerable amount of thought (and planning), they have decided to offer younger travellers who are not quite 18 years old, the chance to take part in some of the gap year volunteering programmes.
WAVA have chosen Mozambique, South Africa and Thailand as the first destinations to be included in the new gap year programme for students eager to find out more about the developing world and its conservation issues.

WAVA's School Volunteer Groups programme offers structured outdoor projects that provide hands-on animal and environmental work for students aged 16 to 17.

These students get to travel to meaningful projects in inspiring countries around the world, and experience new cultures and conservation practices that have been designed to contribute to their personal development.

Hordes of young people have approached us in the past wanting to travel and help other countries. WAVA feel that it is only fair that we give them the opportunity to do so. After all, the young people of today will 'hopefully' be the champion volunteers of tomorrow.

Work in Australia

	View our work and travel programs in Australia. On our guide to working in Australia where you can read information, get advice and apply for your dream job. With One World 365 you can apply for a working holiday in places like Sydney, Perth, Melbourne, Brisbane and the Outback. Australia is perfect for a working holiday; if you’re planning to take time out and would like to experience living abroad, expect friendly people, a warm climate, an outdoors and laid back lifestyle.


	Working Holidays in Australia

	There are lots of jobs in Australia in lots of different professions and wages are generally higher than other countries worldwide. If you would like to know if you are eligible for an Australia work visa please read more information below and also learn how you can apply. 

	A working holiday can be a good way to fund ongoing travel and is a great way to make new friends. It can also be a useful addition to your CV; while most companies don’t look down on a gap year or period of travel, if you can demonstrate that you have worked while travelling this will certainly be in your favor when you return home and are trying to get a job. In order to work while in Australia you will need a specific type of Australia visa. The most likely visa option that you will go with is a working holiday visa. This type of visa is available to those aged between 18 and 30 and allows the holder to live and work in Australia for a period of up to 12 months, though it’s important to understand that the working holiday visa was not intended as a route to permanent migration in Australia, but instead designed for people who want to supplement the cost of their holiday through work.

	A working holiday visa enables you to enter Australia within 12 months of the visa’s start date, and stay in the country for up a year. While the visa is valid, you are allowed to enter and exit Australia as many times are you like. Another important rule to remember is that while you are allowed to stay in Australia for up to a year, you can only work with an employer for up to six months, after which you have to change jobs. That said, you can apply for a second working holiday visa, which will allow you to reside in Australia for a further 12 months but you will only be able to work in Australia for a further six months. To be eligible for this type of visa you may be asked to undergo certain health checks. Also in regards to your health it is recommended, when travelling to Australia, to purchase travel insurance as this visa will not entitle you to Australia’s national health care; this means that if you do need treatment it can be very expensive. Another prerequisite of being accepted for this visa is that you can demonstrate that you have enough money to support yourself, at least for the initial part of your holiday. When entering Australia you must also be able to prove that you have a return or onward ticket or the necessary funds to leave the country.

	Interestingly, a recent addition to the visa process is the Australian Values Statement. This is something that you will have to sign and essentially means that you are declaring that you will respect the Australian way of life and obey the laws of the land. To apply for a working holiday visa, you must be outside Australia; you can’t lodge an application while already travelling in the country. This means that when you are planning your trip it is very important not to book any flights or accommodation until your working holiday visa has been accepted. As mentioned above, it is possible to get a second working holiday visa if you want to stay in one job for longer than six months. In this your application can be made when you are either in or outside of Australia. The only important thing to note is that if you make your application for a second visa while outside Australia you have to be outside when it is accepted. Similarly, should you lodge your visa application while in Australia you must be in the country when it is granted. When applying for a second working holiday visa, remember that you must complete your application well in advance of your first visa’s expiry date, as if your first visa ends before your second is granted you may be liable for deportation.

	It is also worth remembering that each working holiday visa is linked to a specific passport. Therefore, if you change your passport for any reason after you have been granted a visa but before you visit Australia, you will need to contact the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. Otherwise, you will probably be subject to severe delays at the airport and may even be refused permission to board your plane. As a guide, an application for a first working holiday visa will take around six days, while one for a second working visa will take around 21. Working holiday visas also cover study for up to four months. If you would like to study at the same institution for longer than this period then it is possible to do this by applying for a second working holiday visa, as discussed above. Following these steps and securing a working holiday visa before travelling will mean that you are able to fully enjoy your time in this country. If you apply with a sending agency / travel company they will be able to provide job hunting assistance or you can just apply independently and seeking employment in advance or on arrival. There are lots of jobs in different professions in Australia, popular jobs people apply for include working in the hospitality industry behind a bar, cleaning, as a receptionist. In cities you could work in hotels, hostels or in office environments. By working on a farm or on a vineyard you could find yourself picking fruit or helping at a ranch with cattle.

Zimbabwe Black Rhino Conservation Volunteer Programs

	Travel to Zimbabwe and volunteer with black rhinos on animal conservation projects with One World 365. Volunteers are needed at wildlife orphanages, rescue centres and to help directly with rescueing rhinos frmom the wild. Black Rhinoceroses are facing a bleak future with extinction looming, you can play a part in trying to help these beautiful creatures in Zimbabwe. Read on for more information about volunteering with rhinos in Zimbabwe...


	Rhinos used to have large numbers in Zimbabwe, but in the 1980&#39;s and 1990&#39;s poaching was rife and war occured which meant than rhinos become extinct in the Zambezi Valley where they were once in their thousands. After rhinos became extinct in the Zambezi Valley the remaining rhinos in Zimbabwe were moved into conservation areas where they would be safer, and hopefully away from issues like poaching.

	You could volunteer at a safari ranch, wildlife orphanage or rescue centre in Zimbabwe, these placements are perfect if you have a passion for wildlife conservation, or you would like to gain hands on vetinary work experience, or if you would just generally like to help out. You will be resposible for looking after the rhinos and full training will be provided. Poaching is still a problem in Zimbabwe, the money made from rhinos horns can be large compared to normal wages and you will be able to help by trying to catch poachers and by educating local populations about the need to save the rhino.

	 

	Travel and volunteer in Zimbabwe with One World 365, search our full list of projects with rhinos or view all of our holidays and trips.

	5 Reasons to Join an Adventure Bus Tour

	 

	If it&#39;s your first adventure or you&#39;re a seasoned traveller, an adventure bus is always a good idea.

	 

	Many of these buses tend to offer a hop-on, hop-off service: use it! You can explore more places, meet more people, and take more time. But which one to choose!? There are a lot of options out there. Take a look at what&#39;s on offer before you buy, and see what suits you best - where they stop, what routes they take etc. For example, the Stray Travel tagline is &#39;off the beaten track&#39;, Kiwi Experience advertises itself as how &#39;youthful travellers see New Zealand&#39;, and G Adventures specializes in small-group custom made travel. There&#39;s definitely something for everyone.

	But what are the reasons for hopping on in the first place?

	 

	 

	1. The Driver

	 

	You might think they&#39;re just the floating head or the bodiless voice at the front of the bus, but you&#39;d be wrong.. they are so much more.

	 

	They&#39;ll play a part in your travelling family as much as anyone else you meet - in my experience they&#39;ll join in with your activities, they&#39;ll take you to great views, show you some of their favourite spots, tell you local stories, provide all the information you need, become great drinking buddies and (perhaps most importantly) book your accommodation.

	 

	I&#39;ve seen drivers that do spontaneous bungee jumps, snow tube like a boss, down shots on a pub crawl and have balloon making competitions on the bus. I&#39;ve been taken on walks that I wouldn&#39;t have known about and been rewarded with the most incredible views and photo opportunities.

	They&#39;ve got your back, and they want you to have a great time.

	 

	2. People

	 

	Yes, if you don&#39;t travel on an adventure bus tour you will still meet a variety of people from all over the world. But there&#39;s something about being thrown together and spending hours travelling, nights in new places and sharing new experiences with a group of people that is incredible. If you spend anything over 3 days on the same bus at a time you&#39;ll grow together, you&#39;ll become some sort of wonderful dysfunctional family.

	 

	There was a gang of us that were from the UK, the Netherlands, Malaysia, France, Germany, Spain, Canada and America - and it was the best fun I&#39;d had.

	 

	I learnt so much from them - from the ways of a Dutch sense of humour, to the ins and outs of Spanish politics. Unsurprisingly lack of wifi is one of the best things that can happen to you: playing card games followed by multi-lingual scrabble and a big group meal, is a sure fire way of making incredible friends and great memories.

	 

	 

	3. Safety

	Safety in numbers also applies whilst travelling. Adventure buses provide you with a feeling of safety and security when you most need it, not only are you travelling in a group so that potential feeling of loneliness doesn&#39;t creep in but, the bigger companies especially, can also give you guaranteed nightly accommodation and book you a number of activities on a daily basis. It can put your mind at rest and makes travelling that little bit less chaotic and stressful, and a whole lot more enjoyable.

	 

	It caters to those that want an element of organisation along with some spontaneity, and also those that want all of the spontaneity without having to think of how to get there each time.

	 

	With your ability to hop-on and hop-off, if you want to escape a place you feel like you&#39;ve spent one too many nights in you can just hop on again and be transported to the next stunning destination. It really can be a lifeline.

	 

	4. Activities

	 

	Adventure buses are definitely one of the best ways to get the most out of the most adrenalin packed countries in the world. There&#39;s skydives, bungee jumps, kayaking, glacier hikes, helicopter flights.. and your driver can book them all. There&#39;s so many things to do - each location comes with a different selection of activities, if you don&#39;t fancy any of them you really don&#39;t have to spend your money on them, but if you do want to do something just go for it! You&#39;re bound to regret it if you don&#39;t, and what&#39;s the point in being in New Zealand if you don&#39;t grab every opportunity with both hands?

	Some things can be discounted as part of your tour deal and you get to do it with your travelling family.

	Seemingly simple things like doing doughnuts in a water taxi followed by a four hour walk in apocalyptic, torrential rain can make for ridiculous but great memories. It might&#39;ve been awful at the time, but I&#39;m glad I did it now! And let&#39;s be honest, it wouldn&#39;t have happened without my adventure bus.

	 

	5. The Journey

	 

	It might sound obvious, but the locations you travel to and the journeys you take to get there make everything worthwhile. Depending on which company you travel with you can visit places you hadn&#39;t considered before leaving home and see things you hadn&#39;t imagined.

	Sure, however you travel you&#39;ll see amazing things - but by doing an adventure tour you&#39;ll get to enjoy the travelling from place to place on a bus full of friends, laughing, music, and chatter.

	 

	There are a number of bus services available in New Zealand that can get you from place to place, and that offer nationwide passes, including; Intercity, Naked Buses, Nelson Coaches etc. These can still be used as great options for one-off spontaneous trips, especially to places your bus might not visit. But you won&#39;t get that camaraderie, that sense of adventure and that element of fun if you use it for your whole experience.

	 

	Whichever you choose, you&#39;ll get stories to tell and experiences you&#39;ll laugh about later.

	 

	I promise.

	Scuba Diving in Iceland

	When you think of Iceland you probably image great landscapes and the Northern Lights, but what you might not know is that this is a really fantastic country to go scuba diving.

	 

	Top Reasons to Go Diving in Iceland

	By booking a dive in Iceland you will get to experience something you will always remember, in one of the most different dive locations in the world. There is also amazing water visibility, great photography opportunities and bizarre creatures to be seen. Most dive instructor are also from Iceland and so you will also get to learn more about the country, culture and dive sites.

	 

	Best Scuba Diving and Snorkelling Sites in Iceland

	The most popular dive site in Iceland is probably Silfra, a glacial-water-filled ravine that is located between the tectonic plates of Europe and North America. This is a world famous dive site which is unique, not many places in the world can you go diving inbetween two tectonic-plates. This is one of the best cold water dive locations on the planet and somewhere you might want to visit if you are a total beginner or advanced level. You will get full preparation and a dry suit which will be needed due to the temperature of the water. On the journey to Silfra, you will get to visit the spectacular Thingvellir National Park, this country really is one of the most scenic places to go scuba diving in Europe. 

	 

	Can Anyone Scuba Dive Between the Tectonic Plates of Silfra?

	Silfra can be a challenging dive site even if you have previous experience of diving, this is due to the extremely cold waters which most divers are not used to. It can take some time and adjustment to get used to wearing a dry suit which might suprise you how heavy they are especially when the other equipement is added.

	 

	Best Time to Go Scuba Diving in Iceland

	Iceland has very unpredictable weather and we recommend going diving during summer when the weather and climate is warmer. Another great time to dive is from September to April when you will get to combine diving with seeing the Northern Lights.

	 

	How to Book a Course

	You can book dive courses in advance online or once in Iceland in places like Reykjavik. Iceland really is one of the most up and coming scuba diving destinations abroad for people seeking an authentic experience away from the hustle and bustle of places like Thailand. We recommend getting here before the crowds arrive.

	 

	Iceland Dive Reviews

	If you would like to review a dive centre, excursion or experience please get in touch we would love to hear from you.

10 Amazing Experiences of My Working Holiday in the USA

	Nitika Erueti-Satish from the UK has always been an adventure chasing kind of girl and is currently working in America on a J1 visa. She has been in the United States for 9 months now living in the Bay Area (San Fran to the East Bay – Oakland) and has enjoyed every minute of it, Here she shares the highlights of her trip and the top 10 things she has done so far.


	
		
			
				Top 10 Moments of Working in the USA
			
				10 Highlights of My J1 Working Holiday in the USA
			
				My Top 10 Highlights of Working in the United States
			
				10 Highlights of a Year Working in the United States
			
				Want to Work in the USA? 10 Amazing Experiences of My Working Holiday
			
				 10 Amazing Experiences of My Working Holiday in the USA
			
				My Unforgettable Year Working in the USA
			
				 
			
				 
			
				The whole experience of living and working in the USA still doesn&#39;t seem real to me, I have had so many surreal and exciting experiences. From the food to the concerts, to finding a job or two, enjoying time with my family, making new friends and not to mention taking in all of the sites I have been able to visit.
			
				Scroll down to check out my top 10 moments that I still can’t believe have happened to me this past year starting with…
			
				 
			
				10. Portland, OR
			
				
			
				My first impression of Portland had me feeling more connected to nature than I have ever been since moving to the US. This city is situated amongst beautiful snowy mountains and has the amazingly gorgeous Colombia River, the largest river in the Pacific Northwest region of America, acting as a boarder separating Oregon and Washington State. The people are extra friendly and are always down to help you find your way or give you some advice about things to do. It’s also a foody city so if you love to eat make sure to delegate funds dedicated to satisfying your hunger pains.
			
				My favorite sweet treats to try was the Voodoo Doughnuts and ice-cream from Salt n Straw. When I was feeling a little low and needed a boost I always found myself hitting the food trucks located in downtown Portland between Southwest Alder and Washington Street (best times to go is around lunch). For epic scenic views I’d recommend checking out the Japanese Gardens or booking a seat on the Afternoon Half-Day Multnomah Falls and Columbia River Gorge Waterfalls Tour provided by Hub World Travel.
			
				 
			
				9. Universal Studios
			
				
			
				If you’re a film/cinema junky you will fall head over heels in love with Universal Studios. This is my most favorite part of LA. I was also lucky enough to experience the studios with my cousins from Aotearoa, New Zealand and we had a blast. The Harry Potter attraction was my most favorite of all. It was very well built and every single detail seen in the movies was perfectly carved and sculpted to give you that real life feeling of being a young wizard running amuck in Hogwarts.
			
				My second favorite was the Jurassic Park attraction. The ride scared the shit out me not to mention left us soaking wet! Definitely invest in a waterproof poncho or trash bag before jumping on these rides! I’m sure they sell these at Universal Studios but it will be cheaper buying them at the Dollar Store.
			
				The only downside to attending such a heavenly place is waiting in line. Sometimes it can be a 30 – 45 minute wait to get to the front of the line. If you have cash to burn I’d recommend splashing out on a Universal Express pass that gets you a 1 day general admission with a one-time express access to each ride, attraction and seated show. I would also like to quickly mention that there is a real life Moe’s bar that sells Duff Beer and it is divine!
			
				 
			
				8. LA Angels Base Ball Game
			
				
			
				I’ve never been a fan of Base Ball but there is something about a live game that really gets me going. Luckily for me I have loving cousins who spoil me and hooked it up with tickets. The Angels Stadium in Anaheim is so big! There are concession stands all around stocked with loads of sugary treats, sodas, pretzels, hot dogs and more but the thing that stood out for me was the walking concession stands crawling through the seated crowds yelling out at the top of their lungs “CHURRRRRRO’S” or “COTTON CAAAANDY”. My overall experience of the game was pretty great, I had a great time and more importantly the Angels won!
			
				 
			
				7. BART (Bay Area Rides Together)
			
				Here in the Bay Area one of the main sources of public transportation is riding the Bart (train). It may seem a little crazy having Bart in my top 10 list but as the saying goes “don’t knock it till you try it” because being a passenger on these trains is actually pretty entertaining. You are guaranteed to see dancers, singers, poets and other forms of entertainment busking on the trains. They normally perform, between stops and ask for a small donation after their performances. This by far is such a cool thing to witness! Of course you will also see the usual drunks, preachers, verbal exchanges, beggars and homeless on the Bart that adds to its unusually hip feng shui. On that note the Bart is safe. There are always Bart Police around and the controllers are pretty cool too!
			
				 
			
				6. The Holiday’s
			
				
			
				The holiday period kicks off around Thanks Giving which always falls on the 4th Thursday in November each year. Traditionally this holiday symbolized the blessing of the harvest. It was pretty much a party the pilgrims put on to come together with the Native Americans over the sharing of a feast before the pillaging took place. But that was back in the old days. Now days it’s all about that family time and bonding. A good tip I’d like to mention is save your money because the Thanks Giving and Black Friday sales are crazy!
			
				The best times to get to the malls or outlets are around 7pm (they are normally open till 2am) or early in the morning on Black Friday at 6am. No lines, no fuss and most importantly no customer tug a war in between the isles. Christmas time is super amazing! America really does it BIG! From the giant 55 foot Christmas trees decorated with enough lights to light up a small town to the street parades, this country invests so much into Christmas. It’s truly a magical experience and if you’re over in the East Coast you will be able to have a white Christmas.
			
				New Years was pretty low key for me this year only because I fell ill with the flue but there are a few awesome New Year’s festivals across the country.
			
				 
			
				5. NBA Game Trail Blazers v.s Charlotte Hornets
			
				
			
				Getting the opportunity to see a NBA game live is such an exhilarating experience. And before you ask, yes, I bought a foam hand! The mid time breaks where the cheerleaders and dancers came out to perform really hyped up the crowd and the games coordinated with the fans really brought the whole experience to life. If you are ever feel like going to a game (any game, bball, baseball, football) use an app called StubHub or Gametime to find your tickets. Watching the Trail Blazers was such a great activity and it was such a close game 105 – 107 to the Trail Blazers. The next game I’m going to will definitely have to be a Golden State Warriors game here at Oakland’s very own Oracle Arena.
			
				 
			
				4. Afropunk Festival
			
				
			
				This festival is located in Brooklyn, New York and is a two day event made up of 5 stages showcasing an abundant of national and international musicians. Afropunk is an influential community of young, gifted people of all backgrounds who speak through music, art, film, comedy, fashion and more. A friend and I attended this festival last year in August and it was absolutely incredible. I saw so many of my favorite musicians like; Solange, Gary Clark Jr, NAO, Willow Smith, SZA, Princess Nokia, Macy Gray, Little Simz and many more.
			
				The fashion scene had me like OMFG! There so many creative people roaming the crowds in body paint, glitter, make up, hair extensions, there was this guy who had used mesh and wire to construct horns out of his own dreadlocks, that’s how cool everyone was! When you go to this festival get as creative as you can, be as loud as you can and do whatever feels the most natural. It is a carefree environment where you are able to express yourself as openly as you want to. This festival was insanely amazing and I would fully go back again. We even got to see a speech made by Spike Lee as he revealed the trailer for his new show called “Shes Gotta Have It” on Netflix.
			
				 
			
				3. New York City
			
				
			
				A few things you need to know about New York is that it is HUGE! The city really doesn’t sleep, things are really open 24/7 and the hustle never stops. We stayed in Brooklyn for the first part of our trip and fell in love with the whole Brooklyn vibe. Brooklyn has swag like no other. One thing that stood out for me was the street art dedicated to showing off its hip hop culture and history. Another cool thing to do is cross the Brooklyn Bridge but beware its hella busy so stick to the walking lanes at all times or you are most likely to hit by a cyclist. Also if you seem to find yourself a little parched once you walk to the middle, have no fear there are fruit and drink carts posted up along with sketchers and photographers ready to make your experience that much more memorable.
			
				Williamsburg is also a great little town that also has a lot of street art, local eateries and cafes along with one of the best views the city has to offer. This is down on Kent Street where you get a view of the Williamsburg Bridge, the Port as well as a view of the NYC skyline. From here you can walk over the Williamsburg Bridge into downtown Manhattan.
			
				We also did a quick visit to Harlem and it was like being in a totally different country. So many Jamaicans! While wondering the streets we came across a Carnival community concert showcasing a range of West Indies musicians. Carnival in the East Coast is a Labor Day parade/celebration of diversity. It’s a big 3 day weekend street rave where people dress up and dance. If you’re interested in seeing shirtless Jamaicans getting their “Dutty Wine” on then Carnival 2018 is for you!
			
				Times Square was also another highlight for me. If you aren’t afraid of crowds and don’t have epilepsy then this is the place for you. If you’re there to sight see then definitely go at night but if you are there to shop then go during the day. Take some tipping cash with you because you are bound to come across street shows, painters, graffiti artists, performers and people trying to promote their cd’s and music. I once was seduced by a rapper who tried to get me to buy his cd and when I declined rhymed for me as a method of flirting. Men in NYC are play in a whole other field to what I’m use to back home. I feel like the men in New York have that magic, that confidence that sweeps you off your feet. I believe it’s called ‘game’.
			
				During my time in New York I was lucky enough to visit the 9/11 memorial site and museum. This was such an emotional experience not only for me but for all the other hundreds of people who entered the facility that day. Inside is two separate sections that tell the story of what happened on the day of the attacks through narrating stories, interactive technology, archives and a collection of artifacts salvaged. It was an incredibly moving experience.
			
				 
			
				2. Concerts/Gigs
			
				
			
				One of the best parts about being here is all the shows I have been to. I really love going to concerts and festivals, raving is the best feeling especially when you have a great group who raves with you. So far apart from Afropunk, I have been to around 5 concerts and 4 festivals. I have seen the likes of Fiji, Mango Kings, Jordan T, CRSB, Sammy Johnson, Common Kings, Eric Benet, Andra Day and many more perform in the 9 months that I have been in America. I have been around for the Island Reggae Party in Long Beach, Oaklands Pride Fest, A’s Fest and have been blinded by what I saw at the Folsom Street Fair hosted in San Francisco. I normally keep an eye out on apps such as Eventbrite, Ticketmaster and Ticketfly for details and ticket pricing. I am a huge reggae fan so to see my most favorite bands perform has been a dream of mine fulfilled.
			
				 
			
				1. Oaklandish
			
				
			
				Finding my job was one of the hardest parts of my journey. When I first arrived in America I was staying at my relatives place in Riverside, California. I exhausted websites such as Monster.com and Indeed.com sending loads and loads of resumes out and getting hardly any responses back. I then moved from Riverside to the Bay Area where I found my almost full time job as a sales consultant and key holder for a locally owned apparel store called Oaklandish.
			
				Oaklandish is a B-Corp organization who uses local artists to design unique prints that represent Oakland City. Most of our apparel is design and printed in Oakland gaining credible authenticity across all apparel and products produced by Oaklandish. Partnering with non-profit organizations, Oaklandish is very community driven and annually makes contributions to these local organizations by offering support, designing t-shirts, donations and utilizing staff at community events.  
			
				I work with some pretty amazing people, some, who are also up and coming musicians and who I have had the privilege of seeing live so keep your eyes and ears out for rapper Mylez B, r&b singer Rayana Jay, and bedroom pop singer SampleLov. Working for Oaklandish has been a great way for me to learn more about Oakland and the Bay Area as well as make some pretty incredible friends. Oaklandish gave me a family, a home away from home, and by far has been the best part of my journey. I am really going to miss these guys when I return home.
			
				
				I still have 3 more months to go on my J1 journey and will most likely hit up more sites, states, concerts, restaurants and more so to stay tuned and feel free to follow me on: SnapChat: tikabell11 or Instagram: miss.tika_
			
				Also, leave a comment if you have any questions or recommendations for me!
			
				Thanks for reading!

10 Things You Will Learn on a Marine Conservation Project

	Joining a marine conservation program is an incredible experience to make a difference and also enhance your learning. Here are some of the top things you will learn when on a marine conservation trip...


	 

	1. Oceans Are HUGE

	Oceans cover around 75% of the Earth&#39;s surface and holds over 1.3 billion cubic km of water. You will get a real appreciation for just how big oceans are when you join a marine based program. Taking a boat out into the ocean and not seeing land for miles around will leave you awestruck!

	 

	2. Oceans Keep Us Alive

	Oceans produce a staggering 50%+ of the world’s oxygen - they literally help to maintain the air we breath! This is due to underwater algae, plants and phytoplankton producing a staggering estimated 50% to 75% of the world’s oxygen.

	 

	3. Plastic is a Real Problem

	Human reliance on plastic is causing big problems in the worlds oceans. Plastic when in the ocean can float for thousands of miles bue to the buoyancy and can get eaten by marine creatures mistaking it for food. Plastic is a bad pollutant and having a negative effect on marine ecosystems and willdife.

	 

	4. Animals are Facing so Many Issues

	So many species of marine animals are being added to endangered lists every year due to habitat loss, pollution, poaching and climate change. You can apply to volunteer with animals like turtles, whales, sharks and dolphins where you will get to help and learn more about these incredible creatures.

	 

	5. So Much We Don&#39;t Know

	Oceans cover around 75% of the earth’s surface but less than 10% of the worlds oceans have been explored, there is so much more to learn. We really have only just began to understand the oceans and there is is much we are yet to learn.

	 

	6. Humans are A Real Problem

	Things people use on a day to day basis usually ends up in the ocean leading to pollution of waters and marine creatures. For example shampoos, microbeads and general waste which is dumped into the ocean and these things can have an awful effect on the oceans. This in turn is also bad for humans because we end up eating polluted fish and other marine animals. A recent study found fish in the great lakes in the United States have high doses of anti depressant medication like Prozac due to the huge reliance on anti depressants in the North America. There is the added problem of huge air pollution in countries like China and India because when the rain evaporates into the atmosphere it makes its way into the ocean.

	 

	7. So Many Inspirational People in the World

	There are so many incredible people and organisations in the world working to help the environment, animals and the planet. If you apply to volunteer abroad you are likely to encounter some amazing people who are passionate about the environment and wildlife conservation.

	 

	8. You Can Make a Difference

	By applying to join a marine conservation volunteer program you will be able to play a small role in helping, tasks can include research, monitoring, ocean/beach clean ups and rescuing and rehabilitating wildlife. Once you have been on a marine trip you will have picked up so much new information and knowledge. You will hopefully want to inform others about the problems oceans are facing and encourage yours friends and family to participate on a similar experience.

	How Volunteering aboard offered me the most incredible moments in my life, and change me as a person


	 

	Deciding to Volunteer Abroad

	Late 2017 I was searching for overseas volunteering opportunities, I had a long list for more than one organization in different cities. My 2018 bucket list was full of plans, and I decided to kick off my journey by spreading love in Sri Lanka with Plan My Gap Year. I wanted to experience the culture of this beautiful country and to connect with its people. And I actually felt like home!

	From the day I signed up till the day I left, PMGY team was very supportive in answering all my inquiries and questions. Everything was well organized starting from airport pickup , accommodation, project orientation and culture review.

	 

	Arrival

	The first part of the experience is day one when I faced what is known as “Cultural shock” but pause here! Don’t be frustrated, it’s just the First day

	When you reach you will meet lot of volunteers, the coordinators will give you orientation about the projects, the rules you need to follow and hints about the culture. I remember that I was not so comfortable, I was thinking if I’m in the right place for my vacation!

	I signed up for the orphanage project or what we call it girls home! The program was for 3 hours in the afternoon after they come back from the school, the tasks “as it was communicated “ were to help them with their studies and play with them in the greenery nature outside. But it was much more, the beautiful strong girls made it special for me , it was a “GAIN” and “GIVE” from both sides, and yes its true you gain way more than you actually give. When they feel loved they will give you more love! Their pure white hearts inspire you want to give even more, we spent 2 weeks full of happiness, laughs, dance and random smiles.

	 

	Adopting the culture is the key to success.

	Respect their culture in the way you dress and you act, If they were bare feet don’t be different , take your shoes off, Eat their food, dress the way they do, dance when they dance and practice what they love. We learn when we watch but we leave our footprints when we practice and respect

	 

	Accommodation 

	It will be your second home! You will enjoy the simple life when you are surrounded with lovely friendly people, PMGY put a huge effort to give me the real experience of Sri Lankan people life, and experience the simplicity of this country. The accommodation was basic comfortable, however few things must be taken into consideration like AC, bathrooms, hot showers which can be improved. Food was fine and they were doing their best to meet some dietary requirements for some volunteers. In two days you will feel like it’s home!

	 

	Meeting New People

	Throughout my two weeks in Sri Lanka I was surrounded with lovely people from different countries different cultures and different age groups, but we were all seeking the same objective. I met friends for life whom we shared the same room and meals with, we have also created unforgettable memories. Coordinators and volunteers were my second family, we had beautiful times during the project even in our free time.

	 

	The Real Experience

	It all starts from Day one when you set your own goals and what you want to achieve before going there. The skills you have and your life experience might really change others life so put a clear plan to yourself; my plan for the girls was to inspire and empower them to speak and allow them to talk about their dreams. Every day during my stay I was helping them to write about themselves and read it loudly so everyone can hear and know their thoughts. It doesn’t only help them to be open to their future and how they want to achieve it but also it gives them the opportunity to share their dreams and communicate a vision. However you can’t force them to do it all the time, so I managed to include some competitions, games, dance and fun time with small prizes like chocolate or snacks they love to treat them, which actually inspired them to follow the plan!

	 

	Life Changing Experience

	Sometimes change happens to you when you least expect it, These beautiful girls changed my life, they taught me how life can be simple with a smile, how you can give things that you already miss and How to appreciate these priceless moments. Their kindness took a special place in my heart and mind that can’t be forgotten over years! Love, care and strength is all what they have and they share it with you! You will learn how to appreciate and count blessings that you are taking it for granted

	Was it a real vacation?!

	A BIG YES;  it was voluntary work travel, however relaxation had also secure a spot, beautiful nature, beaches, shops and markets are easily reachable and it’s strong YES for a vacation with purpose, explore the country in your free time, plan for your weekends with your new friends or as solo traveller “as I did” be sure that the coordinators will give you all the needed support to enjoy your travel and be safe.

	 

	Plan My Gap Year project crossed all my expectations, I am passionate about helping kids and youths that was the reason I chose this project, but I have never imagined that this experience change the person inside me. YES I did it once and will repeat it again and again! Other volunteers shared their experience in different projects such as medical, mental health, turtles conservation and elephant orphanage and it met all their expectations. We spent our nights sharing the different experience from all the projects, and some got excited to do more than project a day!

	YES I HIGHLY RECOMMEND PMGY SRI LANKA PROJECTS IT SHOULD BE IN YOUR BUCKET LIST

	You have one life, it’s your choice to make it count

	Testimonials & Experiences

	"I was overwhelmed by the vast number of camp directors who had flown over to Britain to hire staff. Archery classes With so many camps, each catering with a different section of American society, to choose from, it&#39;s advisable to have an idea of what kind of camp you would like to be placed at before you arrive at the fair. As I am undertaking a degree in drama and theatre studies I decided that I would like to teach drama at camp. Each camp had its own stall at the fair, often displaying a poster listing available positions such as general councillor, drama specialist etc. By looking for camps that specified they were looking for a drama specialist, the experience became far less intimidating. Knowing what I wanted to do at camp, meant I was able to narrow my search down to a handful of camps that interested me, rather than enquiring about positions at the 300 or so camps which were recruiting at the fair."

	"I had a lot of fun at the camp fair but I attended but I didn&#39;t get hired which was dissapointing. If you find yourself in this situation don&#39;t get disheartened though - you will still get the opportunity to get placed in the run up to summer."

5 Flexible Freelance Jobs That Allow You To Travel

	Travelling around the world is usually on the wish list of everyone. However, very few can achieve this as much as they would love to.  Usually, money and time are the main limitations. Lack of money is important but, thanks to modern technologies, we now have job options that are flexible enough to allow travel whilst also receiving good earnings at the same time. Maybe you could think that being a flight attendant is one of them, but wouldn’t you prefer to fly to your own schedule rather than your employer’s?  Here are 5 great freelance jobs that you can learn and mix your passion with the places of your dreams.


	 

	 

	1. Designer

	Designing has creativity in its roots and there’s no way that we can or should avoid this. The more your mind is encouraged and challenged with visual stimuli, the more experiences your mind will have to create from. If your creativity is on fire, then all you need is the occasional fast Wi-Fi connection to video conference your clients to keep them satisfied. There are many online options for finding jobs in this area such as on the website, WebDesignJobs.

	 

	 

	2. Developer

	As of 2014, 11 million professional developers were employed worldwide and, with the arrival of the Cloud and the boom of mobile devices, this number is very likely to increase. For any software development, all you need is knowledge, ideas, and a good internet connection. Therefore, developers have great opportunities for working from home or on the road, as long as your client is secure in the knowledge that they can rely on you meeting deadlines. You can find hundreds of freelance developer roles on tech recruitment sites such as Dice.

	 

	 

	3. Journalist/Copywriter/Blogger

	Journalism has a greater quality should the topic derive from your passion. Therefore, travelling to the core place of the topic would very likely fulfil both your work objective and your travel desire. There is currently a huge demand of digital copywriters and bloggers, in particular, with freelance roles available at many leading travel websites if you send your CVs out with examples attached of your work. If you would like to work abroad and get paid as a writer get in touch with us today - we are always seeking talented travel writers.

	 

	 

	4. Community Manager

	As with Journalists, the opportunities for Community Managers are clearly favourable in the current job market; there are over 80 digital communities with more than a million users each. On top of that, Social Media is currently in a boom for any company that is looking for positioning in the market, yet employing someone full-time may be beyond their budgets if they are a smaller business. Surely it’s not difficult to imagine yourself managing community accounts of several companies whilst getting to know the world, especially if it’s in an industry that you love such as gaming.

	 

	 

	5. Translator

	If you truly want to throw yourself into a different culture, then it’s likely that you’ll become fluent at the local language; especially if you plan on travelling through South America and Mexico. Living abroad can help you develop your second language, whilst perfectly positioning yourself as a freelance translator either from or into English.

5 Reasons to Join an Adventure Bus Tour

	If it&#39;s your first adventure or you&#39;re a seasoned traveller, an adventure bus is always a good idea. Many of these buses tend to offer a hop-on, hop-off service: use it! You can explore more places, meet more people, and take more time. But which one to choose!? 


	There are a lot of options out there. Take a look at what&#39;s on offer before you buy, and see what suits you best - where they stop, what routes they take etc. For example, the Stray Travel tagline is &#39;off the beaten track&#39;, Kiwi Experience advertises itself as how &#39;youthful travellers see New Zealand&#39;, and G Adventures specializes in small-group custom made travel. There&#39;s definitely something for everyone.

	But what are the reasons for hopping on in the first place?

	 

	1. The Driver

	You might think they&#39;re just the floating head or the bodiless voice at the front of the bus, but you&#39;d be wrong.. they are so much more.

	They&#39;ll play a part in your travelling family as much as anyone else you meet - in my experience they&#39;ll join in with your activities, they&#39;ll take you to great views, show you some of their favourite spots, tell you local stories, provide all the information you need, become great drinking buddies and (perhaps most importantly) book your accommodation.

	I&#39;ve seen drivers that do spontaneous bungee jumps, snow tube like a boss, down shots on a pub crawl and have balloon making competitions on the bus. I&#39;ve been taken on walks that I wouldn&#39;t have known about and been rewarded with the most incredible views and photo opportunities.

	They&#39;ve got your back, and they want you to have a great time.

	 

	 

	2. People

	Yes, if you don&#39;t travel on an adventure bus tour you will still meet a variety of people from all over the world. But there&#39;s something about being thrown together and spending hours travelling, nights in new places and sharing new experiences with a group of people that is incredible. If you spend anything over 3 days on the same bus at a time you&#39;ll grow together, you&#39;ll become some sort of wonderful dysfunctional family.

	There was a gang of us that were from the UK, the Netherlands, Malaysia, France, Germany, Spain, Canada and America - and it was the best fun I&#39;d had.

	I learnt so much from them - from the ways of a Dutch sense of humour, to the ins and outs of Spanish politics. Unsurprisingly lack of wifi is one of the best things that can happen to you: playing card games followed by multi-lingual scrabble and a big group meal, is a sure fire way of making incredible friends and great memories.

	 

	 

	3. Safety

	Safety in numbers also applies whilst travelling. Adventure buses provide you with a feeling of safety and security when you most need it, not only are you travelling in a group so that potential feeling of loneliness doesn&#39;t creep in but, the bigger companies especially, can also give you guaranteed nightly accommodation and book you a number of activities on a daily basis. It can put your mind at rest and makes travelling that little bit less chaotic and stressful, and a whole lot more enjoyable.

	It caters to those that want an element of organisation along with some spontaneity, and also those that want all of the spontaneity without having to think of how to get there each time. With your ability to hop-on and hop-off, if you want to escape a place you feel like you&#39;ve spent one too many nights in you can just hop on again and be transported to the next stunning destination. It really can be a lifeline.

	 

	 

	4. Activities

	Adventure buses are definitely one of the best ways to get the most out of the most adrenalin packed countries in the world. There&#39;s skydives, bungee jumps, kayaking, glacier hikes, helicopter flights.. and your driver can book them all. There&#39;s so many things to do - each location comes with a different selection of activities, if you don&#39;t fancy any of them you really don&#39;t have to spend your money on them, but if you do want to do something just go for it! You&#39;re bound to regret it if you don&#39;t, and what&#39;s the point in being in New Zealand if you don&#39;t grab every opportunity with both hands?

	Some things can be discounted as part of your tour deal and you get to do it with your travelling family. Seemingly simple things like doing doughnuts in a water taxi followed by a four hour walk in apocalyptic, torrential rain can make for ridiculous but great memories. It might&#39;ve been awful at the time, but I&#39;m glad I did it now! And let&#39;s be honest, it wouldn&#39;t have happened without my adventure bus.

	 

	 

	5. The Journey

	It might sound obvious, but the locations you travel to and the journeys you take to get there make everything worthwhile. Depending on which company you travel with you can visit places you hadn&#39;t considered before leaving home and see things you hadn&#39;t imagined.

	Sure, however you travel you&#39;ll see amazing things - but by doing an adventure tour you&#39;ll get to enjoy the travelling from place to place on a bus full of friends, laughing, music, and chatter.

	There are a number of bus services available in New Zealand that can get you from place to place, and that offer nationwide passes, including; Intercity, Naked Buses, Nelson Coaches etc. These can still be used as great options for one-off spontaneous trips, especially to places your bus might not visit. But you won&#39;t get that camaraderie, that sense of adventure and that element of fun if you use it for your whole experience.

	 

	Whichever you choose, you&#39;ll get stories to tell and experiences you&#39;ll laugh about later. I promise.

5 Reasons to Take a TEFL Course in 2016

	If you fancy exploring a different culture while earning money and gaining invaluable experience, you might want to consider TEFL training. If you’re a native English speaker you could begin an enjoyable and profitable overseas career as soon as you acquire your Teaching English as a Foreign Language qualification. Still aren’t convinced it’s the path for you? Well, here are the top reasons why you should teach English abroad!


	
	 

	1) You can experience another culture, and get paid for it!

	In the current economic climate the dream of spending a significant amount of time living abroad may seem unattainable, but by training to teach English as a foreign language you’ll be opening yourself up to a whole world of career opportunities. Compared with teaching at an international school (for which having a degree and previous teaching experience are usually basic requirements) obtaining a TEFL qualification and putting it to use overseas is relatively straightforward, and there are a huge range of employment opportunities available.

	TEFL teachers are in demand across the world, from Argentina, Mexico, Czech Republic to Thailand, so you should be able to find work no matter what nation you want to explore. And while the wage might seem low in some countries, the cost of living is also likely to be low, so don’t let that put you off. While paying for your TEFL training and flights overseas will cost you to begin with, it’s an investment that you’ll quickly see returns on as you’ll get to earn a wage whist having a priceless experience.

	 

	 

	2) You’ll have the time to enjoy your surroundings

	Often when people go travelling they have to cut a trip short or miss out on experiences they’d been looking forward to due to a lack of funds. But if you’re taking a TEFL course overseas you can choose from so many destinations! Popular locations to choose from include:

	
		TEFL Courses in Europe
	
		TEFL Courses in Asia
	
		TEFL Courses in Central America
	
		TEFL Courses in South America
	
		TEFL Courses in North America
	
		TEFL Courses in Oceania


	Also teaching English as a Foreign Language contracts typically last six months and working hours are usually very reasonable, giving you plenty of time to explore – and the cash to do it properly. You’ll also be in a position to put down semi-permanent roots, allowing you to live and work alongside local people and really appreciate the nation you’re living in.

	 

	 

	3) You can make a Difference

	The reason why people who can teach English as a foreign language are in such high demand is that many communities living in less affluent nations invest in such teachers through a desire to improve their career prospects and better their lives. While learning English can go a long way to helping them achieve their goals, speaking English will also become a skill they can pass on to their children. So by becoming a TEFL teacher you really could really work abroad and change someone’s life and make a long lasting difference.

	 

	 

	4) You’ll get to Learn

	While you’re teaching English as a foreign language your students won’t be the only ones learning. Even if you don’t intend to make teaching a full time career, a stint as a TEFL teacher will improve your communication, leadership and organisational skills while looking good on your CV. You’ll also get to learn about other cultures and peoples first hand, through constant exposure to a very different kind of life from the one you’re used to. And who knows, you may even learn a new language yourself!

	 

	 

	5) You can completely change your life

	If you want to challenge yourself and break out of your daily routine, teaching English as a foreign language is a fantastic way to do it. Whether you’re taking a gap year or fancy a career break, or just aren’t sure what to do with your life, teaching English as a foreign language for as little as six months can open your mind to new possibilities, give you an entirely different perspective and, just maybe, change your life forever.

All You Need to Know about Street Food in Hanoi

	Aggie Mcdonagh recently visted Hanoi in Northern Vietnam and has put together a guide with everything you need to know about street food in the region. She includes recommended places to eat, a 24 hour itinerary of cafes and rertaurants to visit and also top tips for batering with local street food vendors.

	 


	First of all, it is important to notice that in this vast country, there is a huge difference in food culture between North, Central and South Vietnam. Cuisine in the North is quite plain in comparison to the Central and Southern regions. Due to a harsher climate, there are fewer vegetables, herbs and spices used in cooking. That makes it really delicate and balanced, but on the other hand quite flat. So if you are planning to go on a food discovery trip the best way to start is from North Vietnam making your way south. The warmer it gets the spicier the food becomes, it is a fantastic way to indulge yourself in Vietnamese food culture that gets spicier with every step you take towards Saigon. Travelling this way gives you time to adjust and slowly discover the full pallet of flavours available in this amazing country.

	Hanoi has its own unique food market culture, and it all comes to life early in the morning and again in the evening. Often whole streets turn into big outdoor dining areas, where people of all age groups are enjoying themselves eating and talking. To really get to know it one needs to take it all in with its pros and cons. 

	There are plenty of snacks, meals and drinks to choose from but before you go off familiarize yourself with this short guide to make sure you won’t miss on anything.  

	To start your food experience journey you need to try local beer Bia Hoi (freshly brewed beer) or Hanoi Beer. This can only be accompanied by Nem Chua Ran (fried fermented pork) – it is a common Vietnamese snack and once you taste it you can never have enough of it. 

	That should be followed by any of these traditional meals: Pho (classic noodle soup), Bún Bò Huế (beef noodle soup), Bánh Bao (steamed bun with various fillings), Bánh Cuốn (rice flour rolls with filling) and Gỏi Cuốn (freshly made rice paper wraps). These are fantastic oriental dishes that will fill you up for hours especially when you are on a budget.  To finish off, an absolute must is to try Traditional Vietnamese Coffee or Vietnamese Egg Coffee- both are absolutely amazing served hot or cold and are completely different to the ones we are used to drink in Western countries.  First one is called Cà Phê Sữa Nóng (left photo) - traditionally brewed thick Vietnamese coffee served with sweetened condensed milk. And the latter one Cà Phê Trứng (right photo) is made of egg yolks whipped with sugar and poured over a shot of coffee.

	If you deem to call yourself a real extreme culinary explorer, depending on your personal views and limits you might want to try few Vietnamese ‘delicacies’ while in Hanoi. The first one on the list is dog meat (Thit Cho), it might seem disturbing for majority of us, and however it is a culturally accepted practice to eat it especially in North Vietnam. This product is mainly sold in Tay Hoi district, however bear in mind that many street restaurants in the Centre of Hanoi have it in their menu. Another unusual dish, not for the faint hearted though is a snake meat and snake cocktail. For this experience visit a snake village Le Mat and order your meal. For a starter you are served a cocktail made of fresh snake’s blood, strong rice alcohol and still pumping heart in it, that is followed by a set of dishes made to your liking from this very snake. If this is not enough, you can always try boiled foetal duck egg (Hot Vit Lon) and finish it off with Snake Rice Wine (Ruou thuoc). 

	Do you still look forward to your meal? So what are you next steps? 

	First obstacle you might come across when buying food from street vendors in Hanoi is the lack of a menu in English. This is not always the case, but you need to be prepared for this as it can be really hard to find out what is it that they sell. Sometimes equipped with a ‘Vietnamese Guide’ after a few frustrating minutes you might be able to establish what it is, however at the end of the day a good old glance into the pot is the best option. You are here to explore after all! 

	Your next step is to establish how much you have to pay for your meal. Prices are rarely displayed, mainly because they are often different for locals and for tourists. Be mindful when you barter, even though it is commonly accepted to do so. You might sometimes be in shock when you hear the first price you are being asked to pay. Also if the price you offer in return is too low the seller might get offended... Therefore it is worthwhile to do some research before you start haggling and remember when you do so that they are only trying to make their living.

	Once you decided what food you want to eat and you know how much you have to pay for it, you can sit yourself down and prepare for some culinary exploration…

	And here you might be in for another surprise…all street restaurants seem to use same type of tables and chairs, and it all would be perfectly fine if not for the size of them.  They are tiny! This is something you would expect to see in a Crèche or on children’s birthday party. Where Vietnamese can comfortably sit on them, it is a rather funny view when you see tourists trying to fit themselves on a tiny chair and eat from a tiny table having a tiny amount of space to move your hands or legs. Add to it having to be mindful of scooters constantly passing by within few centimetres from you and you have quite of an experience.

	To summarize, yes it takes time to get used to all of it. Different culture, different norms and different way of looking and things might make you feel a little bit overwhelmed at first. Some might say that eating on the streets of Hanoi is not only a rich culinary and cultural experience but also quite of a challenge in terms of menu, logistics and safety for foreigners. Undeniably though, exploring exotic dishes while sitting squashed between locals, surrounded by a city jungle with all that is has to offer bad and good, you find yourself meeting new people, having interesting conversations and exploring the depths of Vietnamese culture.

Backpacking Across America: Where to Visit And Why?

	For those of you who are considering a backpacking trip, the good old US of A is a popular choice and for good reason. Whether you’re interested in activity holidays or looking for something more relaxing, America’s 50 states have it all.


	The thing about backpacking across America is that although the country is huge, it is easy to get across. Greyhound buses and Amtrak trains offer deals and those on singles holidays can get by on little money by booking with a group travel operator.
	
	So, where to begin on your American odyssey? Think of places you want to visit, look at a map and plot it from one coast to another; it couldn’t be easier.
	
	Start off at the city that never sleeps, New York; there’s a multitude of things to do here. Head to Broadway, see the Statue of Liberty and be dazzled by the bright lights and bustling streets in Times Square. Then visit the site of Ground Zero before walking a few miles to the Empire State Building, tasting a giant slice of pepperoni pizza on the way.
	
	Once you’ve munched your way through the Big Apple, head over to Washington DC, America’s capital and home of the White House. The architecture of the state is renowned, with Union Station remarkably elaborate.
	
	Next, make your way through Virginia to Memphis, Tennessee. Essential viewing is Graceland, where Elvis Presley lived and is now buried. There’s also Beale Street (the birthplace of the blues), and the National Civil Rights Museum, built on the site of the Lorraine Motel where Martin Luther King was assassinated.
	
	From there, you’re not far from Florida, where there’s a strong Latin influence blending with American culture.
	
	As well as the many theme parks (Disney World being the most famous) you can see alligators in the Everglades, taste some delicious Sunshine State oranges and look around NASA’s Kennedy Space Centre.
	
	If French culture interests you, head over to the French Quarter in New Orleans. Devastated by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, tourists still flock to the Big Easy, famed for jazz and Creole dishes gumbo and jambalaya. Here, you can get drunk on Bourbon Street and get around on a mule-drawn carriage.
	
	Once you’re finished there, it’s hard to miss Texas. Over twice the size of Great Britain, Texas is also famous for its cowboy ranches in Dallas, many of which make fantastic adventure tours.
	
	Other things Texas boasts are: being the birthplace of singer Beyonce Knowles; and, of course, the Alamo, a fort in San Antonio, which is considered to have provided the turning point in the Texan revolution.
	
	Head from the second largest state to the largest, Alaska. With rugged beauty and lots of crude oil and gold, Alaska is home to the world’s biggest bears. It’s recommended you go here in June so you can see the midnight sun. Other activities include river rafting, whale watching and glacier tours.
	
	From icy scenes to mountains, welcome to Arizona. Of course, the most famous thing to see here is the Grand Canyon, which was carved by the Colorado River and is over a mile deep. The state of Arizona has vast deserts, which spread over into Nevada, where Las Vegas is located.
	
	Tourists come from all over the world to visit the casinos in Sin City. Another reason for visiting is the pyramid lifts in the Luxor Hotel.
	
	Nevada is right next to California, another must-see state. Mingle with the rich, famous and beautiful in LA, marvel at the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, and explore the amazing Yosemite National Park. Plus, wouldn’t you like to visit the state in which Arnold Schwarzenegger was elected as governor?
	
	After all this, you’ll probably feel you’ve earned a few days doing nothing, so spend some time relaxing and catching rays on Venice Beach, before taking your flight back home.
	
	The land of plenty has much to offer, boasting a variety of attractions, historical sites and activities that can be incorporated into your ideal trip. Whether you’re looking for good value, family-friendly locations, or good old-fashioned fun; go test the American dream.

Best Summer Travel Ideas for Students

	The legendary summer break is as popular as ever and what’s more, the opportunities on offer continue to become more diverse with each year that passes. If you are a student or soon to be graduate currently looking to make plans and want to get your summer sorted check out our top fun ideas for things to do including traveling, adventure, working or learning abroad. 


	Uni life can be exhausting and it is important to get your summer prepared in advance so you don&#39;t waste 3 months being bored. Where you go and what you do can be decided by money, but there are also lots of free and cheap summer travel ideas for students in the UK and all around the world.

	There are also lots of cheap holiday destinations for uni students and ways to travel during summer without breaking the bank. Check out our top 10 things to do for students during summer below.

	 

	1. Work Abroad

	

	Working holidays are always popular, with short term jobs abroad for students and graduates in destinations all around the world. Traditional favourites of becoming an au pair, fruit picking, teaching English as a foreign language (TEFL) and humanitarian or conservation work. The latter can be paid but is more usually on a volunteer basis. Some charities also offer gap year students the opportunity to gain a qualification or training in a particular area, such as sports coaching. 

	Recommended Ideas:

	
		Work in Canada
	
		Work in the USA
	
		Work in New Zealand
	
		Work in Australia


	 

	2. Summer Camp USA

	

	Working at a summer camp in the USA is our top recommendation! This is a job which is a lot of fun where you will get paid to live and work at a camp in America. Companies like Camp Leaders, Camp America, BUNAC, Americamp, CCUSA and InterExchange offer camp counselor jobs in the USA and Canada, get your application in early to stand the best chance of getting hired.

	 

	2. Campsite Seasonal Jobs

	

	Like the idea of seasonal jobs in Europe? Campsites and holiday camps employ a huge number of staff during summer months and are a fun and enjoyable way for young people or students to spend a season in the sun and warmer weather. The country with the highest demand for staff is in France but campsite jobs are also available in UK, Austria, Denmark, Norway and other countries throughout Europe. Campsite courier jobs include cleaning tents and caravans, greeting clients, introducing the facilities and local attractions and dealing with any problems such as illness.

	Bigger campsites also require resort representatives, nannies and childcare helpers, entertainers and sports instructors. Free accommodation in tents or caravans is usually provided. When is seasonal work in campsites and holiday camps available? Contracts are often for full or half seasons between April and September. Posts are usually filled by Easter so it is best to apply early. However, last minute places are also available. Some places also offer holiday rep jobs.

	 

	3. InterRail

	Like jeans, many summer adventures never go out of fashion, such as travelling through Europe by train, known as InterRailing. Eastern European countries such as Albania and Romania have become the new territories to explore instead of traditional ones such as Morocco and south of France. New flights have made many destinations much more accessible for those who only have a short time to explore. Likewise, other continents have opened up to gap year students, such as Australia. With no language barrier to overcome, work is relatively easy to come by Down Under and it remains a favourite among students.

	 

	4. Gain Experience

	

	Applying for internships and joining a placement might not sound like the most exciting way to spend your summer but your future self might actually thank you. This can help you in the long term with job prospects and might help you get a dream job. There are short term summer internships abroad in destinations all around the world where you will get to boost your CV and go sightseeing in your spare time,

	Recommended Ideas:

	
		Internships in Australia
	
		Internships in USA
	
		Internships in Europe
	
		Internships in Asia
	
		Internships in South America


	 

	5. Volunteer in the Developing World

	

	Looking for a unique and rewarding experience? Do something meaningful through international volunteering programs abroad. There are lots of different projects available worldwide for both short and long periods. You could help work with communities or contribute to environmental programs. The hard part is deciding where to go and what to do.

	Amidst the charming cobblestone streets lined with French-influenced architecture, keep your eyes peeled for shops featuring local chocolate, waffles or fries: all are distinctly Belgian, and unparalleled in both richness and quality.

Europe Gap Year


	 

	Europe Gap Year

	

	Europe is a historic continent to visit on a gap year and every country offers something different. We help thousands of people plan gap years in Europe every year and there are so many different ideas, adventures and gap year programs available. Gap year jobs in Europe are very popular but there are lots of structured experiences and trips. The hard part is deciding where to go. 

	There are no specific reasons why you should take a gap year to Europe, you could be finishing school or university and not sure what to do after? Maybe you just want to do something different and travel? You could be stuck in a dead-end situation and need a fresh challenge? On One World 365 you can find gap year programs in most European countries. Where you go really comes down to personal choice, most programs can be joined from 1 week, whilst some can last over a year. 

	There is a real difference between booking a week’s break somewhere in Europe and soaking up the place and it’s culture, and going somewhere for several months with a purpose; getting into the way of life and its people. Participating on a gap year program in Europe isn’t about doing the wildest things you can possibly think of all day for a year. Many opportunities require that you work on a designated project for a period of time, giving you some ownership in tasks and requiring you to mix with locals. All of this is good for jolting you out of a rut, if you’re stuck, or growing your confidence if these are you first steps in to a bigger world.

	If you decide to take a gap year in a European country, at your doorstep is a multitude of cultures easily accessible by budget flights, buses and trains. Not only that, but pricewise, accommodation is on the low end when compared to some other continents. Whether going for a weeks or longer, it has been made so easy to do. With such a variety of history and entertainment, there is no shortage of places to go and things to do. Meaning it makes little difference whether your trip is with friends, a partner or by yourself. Unsure quite where and when to go? There are so many different experiences available in countries throughout the continent.

	If you would like to spend your gap year working in Europe you can search lots of positions on our directory. From short term summer jobs to fixed long term placements you have a lot of choice depends on your skills. Where you go and what you do really depends on your own interests, you might like to view our featured jobs above to get started. 

	After a gap year in Europe you will be able to impress your parents and friends with new - found culinary skills, tales of all the challenges that you overcame – home sickness being one of them, and oh so important map - reading skills. Seeing Europe first hand gives you unparalleled knowledge about other cultures, religions and mainly about people. This is a great opportunity to become attuned to how other countries live and it is undoubtedly a culturally rich experience to visit different countries across the globe. Our programs are open to UK/EU citizens whilst we also process enquiries from people from Australia, New Zealand, USA, South Africa, Canada and other worldwide destinations.

	 

	 

	"I would highly recommend volunteering to anyone looking to stay away a little longer and do something special. I initially applied for the experience and to help, and by the end of my placement I had made friends for life." - Kate, UK

	"The experience taught me that age and nationality are of little importance and that you do not have to spend money to have fun or see something beautiful. I made friends for life. Voluntary is about the people". - Hannah volunteered in Greece with Concordia

	"I worked with teenagers aged 14-17, they were mostly Russian speaking Estonians, but there were also teens from other countries. It was an excellent experience, I learnt a lot, particularly about the experience of the teens as Russians living in Estonia. It was also very interesting to meet and work with the volunteers from all over Europe (I was the only English volunteer). We got on well and I hope to keep in touch long term with some of them". - Caroline, English project in Estonia

	"I will definitely do it again next summer , it was an unforgettable two weeks" - Aliya, UK 

	"Tours in Europe are great when you don’t know where to go, what to see, but sometimes you don’t want structure. Sometimes you want to explore, get lost, see how the locals live; this is where a tour company such as EF College Break is a good choice. These are educational tours for ages 18-28.  Sure they have fully guided tours as well for those that wish for a more structured holiday, where as College Break provides just the right amount of “me time”. One day you can join a tour of the Palace of Versailles, the next you hop on the Metro and wander to the Champs Elysee with your new friends/roommates." - Sasha Mitsch

	"I did a 23 day tour around Europe with TopDeck which I would highly recommend to everyone." - Matt, New Zealand 

	"My advice to anyone contemplating travelling alone in Europe is to try a tour. It’s a great confidence booster and well worth the money you pay. It was hassle free as all the important things were taken care of, and it also meant I was seeing all the main attractions at each destination but still having the opportunity to do my own exploring and finding hidden treasures of my own. All you need to worry about is deciding which trip to go on." - Karyn Hicks, UK

	"If you are looking for a wild party with no sleep and friends for life choose a tour with Contiki. When I was living in London I booked a few tours in Europe with Contiki and they were honestly the best time ever. They are just easy and save you a lot of time and effort." - Liz, Australia

	"I got my TEFL certification in Spain with TtMadrid which I really recommend. The course was intensive but the friendly staff made everything easier for us to learn and improve. TtMadrid reviews are very positive, they help you right from arrival!" - Sanj, India

	"Working on the project was a unique experience – I hope to do many more. Everyone should be a volunteer!" - Ruth, festival project participant

Fiji: An archipelago of contrasts

	The Yasawa Islands of Fiji are full of contrasts. The Fijian archipelago sits in the Pacific Ocean, 1,300 miles north east of New Zealand, and benefits from spectacular scenery, a temperate climate and friendly locals. These attributes draw visitors from across the world, and for a number of reasons; whether it’s for a relaxing holiday, a stop on a round the world tour, or a romantic getaway, the Fijian islands have something to offer everyone. 


	The best way to experience Fijian culture is to island hop. The easiest way to do this is to book through a tour operator who will tailor a package to suit your requirements. The group of islands known as the Yasawas are easily accessible from the port of Denarau and a designated catamaran runs a hop-on hop-off service most days. Tour companies may offer a stop at one of the three Mamanuca islands; South Sea is a tiny uninhabited island fulfilling the utopian ideal with its white sands, palm trees and clear blue sea. It offers fantastic diving as well as the option to sail by schooner to the island where Castaway was filmed, and visitors are encouraged to sample Kava, a Fijian drink extracted from plant roots.

	Each Yasawa island has its own characteristics and qualities. The island of Kuata is perfect if you are looking for a traditional Fijian experience. The accommodation comprises of a large dormitory style room situated within the main village, allowing visitors to live as part of the community. The facilities are basic but more than adequate; hot water on the islands is rare so expect cold showers! Taken on face value, Kuata doesn’t appear to offer much entertainment, however there are activities available that give a real taste of island life. Kuata is dominated by monolithic mountains, so climb through the forest and take in the spectacular panoramic views across the Pacific. Follow this with volleyball on the beach, or eat fresh watermelon with the locals. There is also the opportunity to learn how to create jewellery using natural materials and traditional methods. Evenings on the island are not to be missed; food is provided by the village and is usually in the form of a buffet serving a variety of traditional Fijian cuisine. On certain nights, the locals partake in cultural dance and encourage visitors to join in. 

	Manta Ray Island offers a different experience altogether. Situated in the ‘Blue Lagoon’ region of the archipelago, the island is visually stunning, with palm fringed beaches meeting colourful coral reefs. Diving and snorkelling are the main attractions here; the clear seas allow an unparralled insight of life in the ocean, with a variety of tropical fish and reef systems. The island derives its name from the manta ray, a species common to the surrounding waters depending on the season. When rays are spotted, the resort sounds a siren meaning a boat trip is departing to the area they are occupying. There is then the chance to swim with the rays, which can grow up to four metres in length. Be quick though as the boat doesn’t wait for long! In contrast with Kuata, the accommodation is a purpose built resort with dorm rooms, but it fits perfectly with the natural surroundings. The bar is set into the hillside, allowing visitors to admire the amazing sunsets whilst enjoying evening drinks. 

	Finish the trip with a visit to Beachcomber Island. With a reputation as the ‘party island’, Beachcomber contrasts completely with the calm of Kuata or Manta Ray. It is the ideal destination for a final get together as the island is geared towards ensuring people have a good time. It is also the place to go for water sports; try parasailing or gliding for fantastic aerial views of Fiji. However this is not the island for people who like their own space; the accommodation comprises of one huge dorm room that houses 100 guests so don’t expect a lot of sleep!

	Fiji has something for everyone, so plan your trip to incorporate the islands that best suit you. Whether you want to relax, party or increase your understanding of a different culture, the welcoming locals and beautiful environment make Fiji a unique experience.

We list some of the best camps in North America which have a long tradition of providing established summer programs, from large independent private camps to YMCA camps. Read on for more information or browse the camps we have listed today.


	 

	Choosing a Summer Camp 

	If you are just getting started you might be wondering how to choose a summer camp so we have put together a short guide with some helpful tips and advice. The camps we feature include day camps and sleep away / residential camps.  You can find camps offering a wide variety of programs including sports camps, activity / adventure camps, arts camps, drama / film school camps, craft and skills camps and camps offering educational programs including science, maths and computing. On our website you can also find specialist camps for children with specific cultural, physical or educational requirements where staff will have skills and experience in meeting these needs. These include religious camps, weight loss camps and a range of camps offering programs and activities tailored for those with disabilities or mobililty / access needs. If you are seeking a different type of experience with Summer Camp 365 you can also locate worldwide summer camps in places like the UK and Australia. 

	Our website navigation is easy to use allowing you to find a camp quickly, you can browse by location, type or by activities on offer. You can also view our top recommended featured camps. Our directory is also 100% free to use and you do not need to register to browse. With Summer Camp 365 you can search thousands of camps today and contact them today to arrange a placement. There are lots of different ways you can search camps, you could search by clicking a specific activity e.g. you could be interested in sports programs or you might want to find a camp in a specific region of North America, e.g. Camps in California. When you click one of the options we have listed below this will open up a new page with the results listed in a clear and easy to navigate format. When you find a camp which appeals to your interests you will be able to read more information, send an enquiry or visit the camps website.

	There are lots of important factors to consider when trying to choose the right summer camp and it is best to read as much information as possible before enrolling. All camps are different and offer specific programs to different ages and genders, sessions can vary in length anywhere from one day to over a 4 week period. Prices for all camps vary depending on the length of participants and programs. You might want to consider location as an important factor, for example if you are looking for a short day camp or less than a week long sleep away you might want to choose a camp close to where you live. But if you are flexible with time geographic location of camps might be little less of an issue. We recommend you browse more than one camp, there are literally thousands on our database and so you might like to make a short list of the best ones. It is also good to match your interests to a specific camp, for example if the participant enjoys camping then a wilderness camp might be best suited or if they are looking to learn a new skill then an activity based camp might be better.

	To register a place at a camp you will need to book in advance, every year millions of children attend camps in the USA and spaces can fill up quick. To help find the perfect summer camp you will need to put together a list of criteria and answer some questions to narrow down your search. There are so many questions which can help decide which camp is the right choice, we have put together some examples which you might want to discuss and you are the best judge to decide after consultation with your child.

	
		Check to see if an overnight, sleepaway or day camp would be best
	
		How much time do you have free, most camp sessions are either 1 or 2 weeks in duration although longer placements can also be found
	
		Would your child be looking just for an enjoyable experience or would they actually like to improve a particular area e.g. sports or academics
	
		Are you open to a coed camp, or would an all boys/girls camp better suit your child
	
		Would you prefer a wildlerness camp in a remote location or something more urban, there are inner city camps throughout the USA
	
		Do facilities matter, some camps have world class high tech facilities but the cost of these camps can be higher
	
		What is your budget, generally private and independent camps are more expensive than agency or YMCA themed camps
	
		If you have more than one child, are there are camps where you can place them both together


	 

	If you start the search with a clear aim e.g. I want a camp where my child can improve their computer skills then you will find using our website much easier to use/find what you are looking for. But also don’t worry if you have no defined criteria, you could browse the different sections of our website to view lots of different camps and then make a short list of your favorites. Summer camps are available via telephone and e-mail and also most camps now have online websites where you can request a brochure or dvd. A lot of camps also have open days where you can visit to meet staff and check facilities. If you need any help or advice about finding or choosing a summer camp please contact us for more information, we can help connect you to the right camps providing your children with a safe, rewarding and most importantly fun learning experience.

France TEFL

	We have put together some useful information about sights you can see and places you can visit when taking a TEFL course and studying or living as a English teacher in France. If you are hoping to take your English teaching skills across to Europe, you could not go too far wrong by checking out all that Paris has to offer. Not only is it under three hours away from London by train, but you will be visiting a city which is compact enough to fit into a long weekend and one which has culture by the bucket load.


	A Guide to Teaching English in Paris, France

	 

	Travelling to Paris from the UK is as simple as getting on a train. The Eurostar has regular services which stop slap bang in the centre of Paris. You could visit for just a day or two or stay for a longer period. If you are checking out Paris with a view to staying permanently, then the Eurostar is a great way to travel to and from the two countries. If you are travelling on a student budget then you can still find accommodation which will suit your limited means or check with your language school and they should be able to help. If you have more money to spare or it is a special occasion, then romantic or luxury boutique hotels are easy to find.
	
	If you are visiting just for a weekend to see if Paris would be a potential destination for you to teach English for around £70 a night you could stay at the Hotel Beaumarchais in the heart of the city. It is close to the Picasso museum and has everything you would expect from a standard hotel room. The rooms are a good size and are painted in nice bold colours. Even cheaper is Le Village; a 25-room hostel which boasts views of the Sacre Coeur from its Montmartre location. While you will be sharing a room, a kitchen and the bar area, the friendly atmosphere of the hostel is something to cherish. If you have a little more to spend, then you might like to try the Murano Resort, which is described as an urban resort complete with a restaurant and DJ bar. The interior has been designed by Raymond Morel and features silvers, reds and a minimalist style. Think Phillipe Stark in terms of the furnishings and take the time to relax in the pool and spa area. This is perfect after a tiring day of sightseeing.
	
	When teaching in France, the heart of the city where the true Parisian experience can be had. Nearly everyone will be familiar with most of Paris’ tourist attractions; but seeing them with your own eyes is something else entirely.
	
	The Eiffel Tower cannot be missed. While the crowds may put you off, a trip up the tower is worthwhile. Built in 1889 for the World Fair, the tower was almost torn down in the early part of last century, as it had served its purpose. However, it was only saved because it was being used for holding antennas for broadcasting. Now it boasts more than six million visitors a year, who either climb their way or take the lift to the top for the amazing views. For something a little more modern, the Centre Pompidou is a sight to behold. The modern art housed within the centre is one thing, but the building itself is testament to the skills of the architect and designer. With the painted pipework showing the innards of the building on the outside, it is an artwork in its own right and can be enjoyed without even having to step foot inside.
	
	A visit to Paris is never complete without a visit to the Louvre. While the queues may stretch round several corners, the wait is certainly worthwhile. To see those great works of art up close is something which everyone must experience and the Louvre does not disappoint. Even those who have little knowledge of art cannot fail to recognise the odd painting or drawing from its vast collection. Of course the Mona Lisa is its most famous resident and should not be left off the itinerary. Even if you choose not to visit one of the many attractions, you can easily find yourself drawn in by the general atmosphere of Paris. With the Seine running down the city&#39;s middle and a number of ornate bridges crossing at regular intervals; the city is beautiful and interesting at any time of the year.
	
	You can usually find a market or two where there are an abundance of cheap statues of the Eiffel Tower to take home, or you can buy a crepe and sit by the riverside taking in the views. Paris is a city renowned for its artists and is full of students and young people. Simply watching the world go by is worth the price of the ticket. Of course, food in Paris is wonderful. The restaurants offer standard French cooking and the best wines and it is easy to find great deals for lunchtimes and evening meals. Street cafés permit outside eating and small intimate restaurants are scattered throughout the side streets. You will be spoiled for choice. The Au Pied de Cochon is famous for its onion soup and its cheap full breakfasts, which are served throughout the week. Or, if you are brave you can try the pigs’ trotters! Prices range from €7 for a starter to €35 for two courses. For dessert, head to the Berthillon for its 70 flavours of ice cream. You can get four scoops for just over €5; enough to share.
	
	Paris is a wonderful place to visit and could be a great place to work as well. The abundance of visitors from around the World makes it perfect for English students or teachers who want to experience a different culture; even if it is just for the weekend.

Funding and Financing a Gap Year

	So you&#39;ve decide to take a gap year and you have now started researching trips and options. Taking a gap year can seem expensive when you add flights, accommodation, meals, sightseeing and activities. Firstly, don&#39;t be put off by the price, some can seem very high but do not panic. We have put together some useful information on how you can finance, fundraise and budget for a gap year including how to afford an experience and save money whilst abroad.

	 


	The cost of a gap year really depends on which destination(s) you would like to visit and how long you would like to stay. In some countries you can spend months spending the same amount as just a few weeks in other locations.

	You might be shocked to realise a lot of experiences will require you to pay a fee, this goes for tours and even volunteering programs. If you have a specific trip in mind, try to work out if it is best/easier/cheaper to do it solo or with a organisation/travel operator. Usually travelling solo is cheaper than joining a tour for example. With large international sending agencies / tour operators you will need to pay a fee to participate but this usually includes all means, accommodation, insurance and transfers. Sometimes applying to a program independently avoids paying the initial fee but when you add up the cost of accommodation and meals over the period it might work out more expensive.

	If you are looking to travel on a shoestring try to avoid expensive countries, for example in Asia Thailand is generally more expensive than Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos. In Central America Costa Rica and Panama are very expensive whilst Brazil has one of the highest costs in South America. If you are planning a trip Down Under Australia is an expensive destination so if you are not doing a working holiday you will need to have sufficient funds.

	Try to calculate the cost of the country you want to visit and work out how much you will need for a daily budget, try to include accommodation, food, drink and sightseeing.

	 

	Before Departing General Tips

	
		
			Try to write down all your current outgoings and see if you can cut down your expenditure. There are lots of ways you can save for example do you really need to get out drinking this weekend? Could you walk instead of taking a bus or taxi?
	
	
		
			Make targets for how much you need to / would like to save
	
	
		
			Get a job, or if you are already working try to get another part-time e.g. working in a shop, bar, cafe
	
	
		
			Be creative, ask your neighbours/family if they need cars washing, babysitting, dog walking, cook food etc
	


	 

	Grants / Bursaries

	Some companies offer sponsorship and bursaries, the best way to find these is to visit your local library and ask for the book of grant making trusts. This book is a great source of information providing details of organisations who offer financial help and donations if you are looking to have a structured experience overseas. You will need to put together a plan and approach them with where the money will be spend. The Royal Geographic Society have various grants available throughout the year too.

	 

	How to Budget When Overseas

	There are lots of ways you can save money whilst overseas, here are a few recommendations:

	
		Book flights and accommodation in advance for the best deals
	
		Stay in hostel dorms instead of hotels, this is generally cheaper
	
		Eat locally and avoid large restaurants 
	
		In touristy areas prices are generally more expensive
	
		Shop at local supermarkets and make your own food, this will be cheaper than eating out 3 times per day

Gap Year Guide FAQ and Advice

	What is a gap year? A gap year is a break from study or work which usually lasts three months to one year. People of all ages take gap years, many young people in the UK tend to take a gap year prior to or following college or university...


	A gap year can include a period of change from living in your home country, to travelling the world undertaking work, volunteering or just exploring. In the UK a gap year when leaving school and before entering higher education is a now a very popular transitional choice.
	
	Even more common is the number of 28 - 40 year olds now taking what is known as mature gap years.
	
	Mini gap years commonly last for a period of six weeks to three months and with the current economic climate more and more people are considering taking time out from jobs, and going on career breaks worldwide or getting experience in between jobs.
	
	Many employers now view gap years as a positive learning experience. A lot of large institutional employers allow employees to apply for unpaid sabbaticals whilst even government departments, for example in Canada allow staff to take 12 month break every five years.
	
	Going abroad is not a necessary component for a gap year, there are thousands of opportunities in countries around the world, for example in the UK you could volunteer with the National Trust or even just have time off work to relax and do something different than the normal 9-5 working routine or you could learn a new skill which will be beneficial to your future.
	
	There’s an exciting new world out there and we’re going to help you explore it!
	
	There are currently over half a million people taking gap years every year, so what are you waiting for?
	Why taking a gap year could be a good idea:
	
	* It improves confidence and broadens your personal experience
	* It demonstrates that you have a proactive, inquiring nature
	* It&#39;s an opportunity to immerse yourself in another culture
	* Possibly become fluent in another language.
	* It can improve your chances of future employment
	
	Why people take a gap year
	
	By the time most students have been to college, the average eighteen-year-old has spent most of their life in full-time education. With increasing pressures in education it is no shock that a growing number of students and non students alike are now choosing to take a break.
	
	For many, a year out can provide the time and space needed to analyse their skills and decide which university and course will allow them to reach their full potential.
	
	Will a gap year / career break be right for me?
	
	Anyone considering taking a gap year, should have the desire to do something different. Want a challenge, and a life changing experience, Do you want to make a difference in the lives of others Perhaps you are feel the time is right to take a break from working and challenge yourself to do something different and worthwhile.
	
	Whatever your age, present employment or ambition, a gap year offers you the chance to do something different which may change your life for the better.
	
	Members of the British royal family have taken gap years. Prince William and Harry chose to have a gap year before beginning his university course. He travelled and gained a variety of new experiences. He undertook a number of new activities during his year, including preparing for survival exercises with the Welsh Guards in Belize, working as a volunteer in Chile, working on a dairy farm in the UK and visiting countries in Africa. Prince William said the favourite part of his gap year was working at a dairy farm in the UK as a farm labourer rising before dawn to milk cows and performing “mucky jobs” along with everyone else thus being treated as an equal. Prince Harry impressed by his brothers experience also took part in a gap year in Africa, helping with building works, assisting in a classroom and playing football with village children.
	
	What are the benefits of gap years?
	
	Most universities view a year out positively. Employers echo this and feel that if the time is spent constructively it can enhance a graduate&#39;s skills, experience and knowledge. A gap year well spent can open your horizons to a new world whilst improving personal and professional skills and can help shape the direction for a future career.
	
	Gap Years - Potential Drawbacks?
	
	You may find out that time away is not best suited for you. If you are planning on going to university it is highly recommended that you check with the universities and course departments to ensure that a year away is fine with them before you commit yourself as some are not too keen for their prospective students to postpone for a year. As well as learning new skills, experience and making friends some people find it hard to motivate themselves or get lonely and homesick.
	
	Gap Year Volunteering
	
	Volunteering as part of your gap year can provide you with a structured and meaningful gap year experience. Volunteers are usually aged 16+ and come from all over the world. Volunteers usually pay their own way, receive no salaries, and are often both a positive and essential ingredient in the success of projects.
	
	By volunteering you can make a positive impact on a project, person or even change your outlook on the world. Try to get as much information as possible especially from past participants who will be able to give you advice about companies and projects. There are a wide range of volunteering possibilities available, from teaching English, to being part of a community building project you can make a difference to the lives of others while gaining an amazing and rewarding experience for yourself.
	
	Why pay to volunteer?
	
	If you have been researching volunteer organisations you might notice that some of the placements are quite expensive. This is usually because the price includes the admin of setting placements up, air fares, accommodation and back up and support whilst you are away.
	
	These all inclusive voluntourism packages are great for a first time traveller or someone who wishes to gain a unique perspective on a new culture through volunteering. Many trips offer a combination of volunteering with a tour or other activities.
	
	If you are a seasonal traveller, volunteer or have specific skills you also have the option to apply direct to a local project, or NGO where volunteering can be free or low cost. In some cases you can be offered free accomodation or meals in exchange for your time and efforts. If you choose the independant path In this scenario you will often be required to make your own travel arrangements and provisions for your trip.
	
	Gap Year Considerations
	
	Voluntary work always looks good on your CV as you could gain vital experience which could help you in your future career. Voluntary work can be quite emotionally and physically challenging, while for others it can be a life changing experience.
	
	You don&#39;t necessarily have to go abroad to volunteer, there are plenty of opportunities in your native country. Time of year is something to bear in mind, due to climate, time of year companies employ temporary workers and seasonal working.
	
	Some organisations may require you to volunteer for a certain period of time, so be flexible. In a lot of placements you will not need any experience to volunteer, your own interests and skills can be more important than qualifications. You could approach charities or voluntary organisations direct by looking up their details.
	
	Gap Year Work Abroad
	
	Working or studying abroad during a gap year is getting easier all the time as business and educational organisations go global. All it takes is a little planning, the right contacts, some background knowledge and you&#39;re on your way.
	
	Gap year jobs can set you off on a new adventure whilst funding it as you go along. Each country has its own educational and qualification system which means that qualifications cannot always be easily used in a different country.
	
	You will need to decide what kind of gap year work you want to do. There are several options including seasonal jobs, permanent work or you could volunteer for work experience. Remember though working abroad isn&#39;t like going on holiday, jobs in exotic locations may sound appealing, but in reality you may not even have time to step foot on the beach!
	
	Gap Year Study Abroad
	
	Studying abroad on a gap year is a great way to integrate into a foreign culture, learning a new language, experiencing the cultural differences whilst being a great learning experience. You might find both the academic and social aspect of studying and living abroad a lot more enjoyable if you know the native language. There&#39;s no better way to speed up learning a language than to be live with locals in a country.
	
	If you&#39;re considering taking a course that&#39;s taught in the native language - law or business studies for example, be aware that this can demand a high level of fluency. Consider too, that if you&#39;re struggling with the demands of the course it, then struggling with the language may be an extra pressure you could do without.
	
	Gap Year Preparation
	
	If you choose to travel abroad and want to do so independently a lot of preparation and planning will need to go into the trip before setting off. You will need to organise your finances, visas and any vaccinations required for certain countries. It is often best to arrange all gap year volunteer, work and travel placements prior to departure as availability may be limited on arrival.
	
	Gap Year Fundraising
	
	Last year in the UK more than one million pounds was wasted and was left lying around in bursaries and grants unclaimed. If you live in the UK and are looking to raise money for your trip, go to your local library and ask to view the Directory of Grant Making Trusts. This includes organisations such at the Rotary club and the Round Table which in specific cases may have money available. Useful websites to visit include: www.bmycharity.com and www.justgiving.com.
	
	Gap Year: What you need to think about:
	
	Decide what particular volunteering experience you would like to pursue?
	How long do you want to volunteer for?
	Do you want to gain experience for a career or just an amazing experience?
	Where should I go?
	
	Try to put together a short list of continents and countries you would like to visit and get advice on travel message boards or consult and travel agency.
	
	Some gap year highlights we recommend:
	
	* Trek the Inca Trail to Machu Pichu in South America
	* See the mystical Ayers Rock, Australia
	* Sunrise at Angkor Watt, Cambodia
	* Do a jungle trek in northern Thailand
	* Trekking in the Himalaya, Nepal for example
	* See the big wild animals on safari in Africa
	* Thrill seeking adventure sports, New Zealand
	* Experience carnival, Brazil
	* Walk on the salt flats, Bolivia
	* Drive route 66, USA
	* Nearer to home in Britain or Europe
	* Inter-railing through Europe
	
	Sample Gap Year Round the World Route
	
	A popular choice for gap year participants is a round the world ticket. With this ticket you can choose which countries you visit, a sample route could be London - Delhi - Bangkok - Sydney - Auckland - Fiji - New York – London, so long as you keep going in the same continual direction.
	Accommodation
	
	Research and book accommodation in advance.
	
	Guide books can be a helpful but be aware that good places go bad and bad places go bust. A little flexibility and an ear to the travellers grapevine can turn up some real gems.
	
	Be aware that availability can be limited especially during events / national holidays so avoid leaving it until the last minute.
	
	If you availability is tight, you need to do some legwork to find a bed for the night and you&#39;re in a group why not someone stays with luggage at a safe place e.g. restaurant or internet cafe while others do the rounds. Yomping round a busy place on a boiling hot day with a backpack is no fun at all. Where you stay can vary enormously according to your trip type, destination, travel group and budget. Hostels can be great places for meeting other travellers or getting info. Homestays can be arranged in many places and are a great way to meet local people and provide insight into a culture. There are websites and organisations to help arranging these.
	
	A little extra cash for the occasional up-market hotel can open a range of options that might provide a memorable highlight during a trip.
	
	Booking Gap Year Flights
	
	Try to shop around for the best deal for flights, there are a huge range of choices and prices available. If you are travelling round the world it might be an idea to book a flexible ticket which means you can change the itinerary at any time. Be-aware of costs / restrictions in making changes to your ticket and carry contact details for your airline in case your plans do change. Consult a travel agency for more information.
	
	Gap Year Money / Budget
	
	Carry a variety of payment methods including ATM cards, travellers cheques and cash (local currency and dollars/euros/pounds).
	
	Popular ATM cards (visa, mastercard etc) are accepted worldwide these days but its worth checking in advance as availability of some card types can be problematic. Be aware that cash machines in remote locations can be out of service, out of money and money exchange counters / banks can be closed because of a public holidays. Have a plan b and c in case your primary payment method isn&#39;t an option.
	
	If you get stuck worldwide money transfer services (western union) etc can be a lifesaver although there are fees.
	
	Gap Year Budget
	
	As a rough guide, Asia is probably the cheapest continent to travel; you can survive on an average budget of around £5-10 per day which includes accommodation and food. Australia and New Zealand budget for around £25 per day. In Europe you might need as much as £30 per day. In North America try to budget for around £20 per day whilst in Central and South America you can get by on around £15 per day. USA, European Capitals, Australia, Singapore, Rio de Janerio and the Carribean are places where additional funds will make life easier and increase your range of options although costs can still be kept down by staying in Hostel dorms, travelling overnight and cooking yourself. Consult a guidebook like the lonely planet for advice on costs on your destination.
	
	Gap Year Travel Insurance
	
	Don’t think about going abroad without travel insurance. When planning a trip insurance might seem like an expensive luxury, but when you are away anything could happen to you or your belongings so it is best to be covered as medical bills could be very costly indeed. If you are taking expensive items eg camera, laptop or planning extreme activities such as skydiving, trekking, climbing etc it is worthwhile. Check Insure and Go.
	
	Gap Year Visas
	
	Once you know which countries you want to visit, check the embassy / foreign office websites for advice about visas, vaccinations, safety and any restrictions.
	
	Gap Year Advice
	
	Research your destinations thoroughly; get advice from the foreign office (fco.gov.uk)
	
	Be aware to the customs of your host country, try to learn about the laws, customs, sensibilites and appropriate dress code
	
	Make an effort to learn some of the local language - even a few words are often warmly receieved and basic familiarity can make practicalities like travel arrangements, finding directions, ordering food etc much easier. One of the real pleasures of speaking the local language is being able to speak with people - to learn of their lives and share a bit of your own.
	
	Gap Year: What to Pack
	
	Passport, plane tickets, travel insurance, visas, photocopies of important documents such as your passport, basic first aid kit, travellers cheques, contact details, clothes and memories of home to avoid homesickness.
	
	Take several copies of important documents - leave one at home with a family member / friend and store another in a safe place online. That way if you lose everything a trip to the internet cafe or a call home can help get you sorted.
	
	A few suggestions for items to consider taking on a gap year…
	
	A robust pair of walking boots / trainers / sandals / flip flops, torch, mosquito net, compass, insect repellent, sunglasses, camera, music, a first aid kit, needle cotton and spare buttons for fixing clothes, a blanket for overnight bus journeys, a sheet or sheet sleeping bag for unsavoury stopovers in cheap hotels, a chain and a couple of padlocks to secure luggage, an outer cover/bag for your rucksack to prevent tampering or opening, a small travel alarm for early morning trains / buses...
	
	Most products / brands are available in your destination (or there will be local equivalents) and often things you may require will be cheaper than at home.
	
	Travel light - its much better to acquire additional things rather than being burdened with a heavy, unwieldy bag. Shipping stuff home can cost a small fortune.
	
	If at all possible avoid buying heavy / bulky souvenirs early in your trip - carry that stone / bronze sculpture for months might not seem like such a good idea after a while.
	
	Gap Year Dangers / Risks
	
	Watch out for scammers, tourist traps and troublemakers. While the majority of people you will encounter will be kind hearted, generous and hospitable be at least a little skeptical of new "friends" (locals and other travellers) especially if they approach you. Often in Asia these are commission seeking travel agents or touts who will resort to any means (and will not take no for an answer) to get you to stay at their (brother/uncle/friends) hotel, ride in their taxi/rickshaw or buy their excursion at a premium.
	
	Always be on your guard for those who would commit crime against your person or part you from your belongings - travel in groups is a safe option especially at night, in remote places and also in popular tourist locations.
	
	If you participate in drugs be aware that the consequences of your activities can be severe including lengthy jail time often in horrific conditions. Also the cost of your recreational activities or habit extracts a terrible toll on local people who in many instances are forced to endure pollution, violence and exploitation by armed gangs as a result of drug production and trade.
	
	Drinking alcohol can cause offense in certain parts of the world and even in more liberal places intoxication can result in all sorts of problems including lost belongings, accidents or even jail.
	
	"Sexual tourism" or involvement with prostitutes is often exploitative and carries risk of sexually transmitted disease. Avoid.
	
	Be prepared in advance if you are visiting an area experiencing severe political unrest, armed conflict, problems due to the drugs trade or terrorism.
	
	Speak to other travellers to get advice on known risks / scams at your next destination.
	
	Above all, don&#39;t be paranoid, human beings can be very generous, hospitable and helpful but do be aware and awake to potential risks.
	
	Gap Year Arrival Advice
	
	Book your first nights accommodation in advance and check for any festivals or large events that might make availability a problem. Also have an idea about how to get from the airport to your hotel before arriving - arrival in a foreign country can be very confusing especially after a long trans-continental flight.
	
	Take time to acclimatise and to familiarise. Arrival in a new place can be exciting and bewildering. Try if possible to avoid doing too much for the first couple of days. Changes in temperature, altitude and diet will require adjustment. Short walks at altitude, protection from hot sun and dehydration and moderation of diet until the stomach has adjusted to local cuisine can all help ease you into your new adventure.
	
	Speak to people on arrival and to get advice / recommendations. The best tips usually come from people who live in, have visited or currently are travelling in your destination.
	Staying in touch
	
	With the advent of the internet (which is widely available worldwide) the world is increasingly well connected and communicating has never been easier.
	
	* Set up an free web based e-mail account eg hotmail, gmail, yahoo etc
	* Get an internet phone account with Skype which is widely available at internet cafes
	* Get a local SIM card for your mobile
	* Use social network websites eg facebook
	* Create a blog and document your journey and the people you meet

Gap Year in Cambodia

	View ideas for taking a gap year in Cambodia - search our programs and apply today. If you’re planning on visiting Southeast Asia during your gap year, we recommend a stay in Cambodia. Nestling between the popular travelling destinations of Thailand and Vietnam, Cambodia is a rough diamond (to go with a gem metaphor) – its tourism infrastructure is not yet as highly developed as those of its neighbours, but it’s getting there quickly. This is a really up and coming travel destination which is rich in culture and also a lot safer to visit than you might think. Visitors are drawn by the spectacular temples of Angkor and the opportunity to sample Khmer culture, and Cambodia gap years are a great way to make the most of a week or so in the country. Despite the genocide and war a few decades ago this is very much a country looking forward and not back. You will get to explore ancient ruins or join structured programs and visit places like Siem Riep, Angkor Watt, Phnom Penh and Sihanoukville. Cambodia which is a really beautiful country but also somewhere which might seem quite exciting and daunting to explore on a gap year but we have lots of programs for students, gradutaes, career breaks. View our guide to taking a gap year in Cambodia today.


	

	Guide to Taking a Gap Year in Cambodia

	
		Siem Riep - A popular destination to visit especially if you have never been to Asia before, there are markets, old buildings, friendly people and lots of backpacker hostels, cafes and bars
		 
	
		Angkor Temples - Located just outside of Siem Riep were built by the kings of the hugely powerful Khmer Empire which ruled for 600 years, are an amazing site. The most famous of all, the 12th century Angkor Wat, is absolutely enormous (5,500 metres in perimeter) and gives you a good picture of the wealth and grandiose of that time
		 
	
		Phnom Penh - The capital of Cambodia where there are many sobering reminders of the Khmer Rouge’s devastating rule during the late 1970s. It is estimated that over a million people deemed a threat to the party were killed as part of Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge’s regime. A memorial dedicated to those who were executed during the genocide can be found at Choeung Ek, the location of one of the many killing fields. This harrowing mass grave site is still littered with human bones
		 
	
		Sihanoukville - You will find some of the best beaches in Asia along the Southern coast in and around Sihanoukville, they are also less touristy


	 

	 

	

	
		Gap Year Tours & Backpacking in Cambodia
	
		We recommend joining an organised overland trip to make the most of your experience in Cambodia. There are lots of different options available for both short / long gap years and also various budget options too. There are lots of small group tours which you can join all year round, taking a tour will be an incredible journey where you will have experienced guides and meet new people from all over the world. Organised group trips are also a lot of fun and a fresh new experience, they are perfect if you are planning a gap year or career break. If you are worried about travelling solo in Cambodia you might want to join an overland trip booked with an international operator. You can travel around Cambodia on public transport which is very cheap but a little unreliable, always try to plan ahead too as when you arrive in a destination you will be swarmed by tuk tuk drivers offering to take you to hotels, hostels or anywhere you fancy.
	
		
			 
		
			 
		
			
	
	
		Gap Year Programs & Work Experience Placements in Cambodia
	
		There are lots of work experience and placements to choose from, you can make a real contribution to a local community during your stay learning a lot about both yourself and Cambodia. Projects can be found in places like Siem and Phnom Penh and include teaching English at local orphanages, working with communities to advocate women’s rights, and helping to care for children with mental and physical disabilities. These projects are made even more rewarding by the positivity and kindness of the Khmer people, despite the turmoil of the recent past. Lots of people join gap year volunteer projects in Cambodia every year, popular options include teaching English where you can help lead lessons and have lots of fun working with children. Most programs will require you to be aged 18+ and be in good health. No knowledge of the local language is required to participate but we recommend learning some basic phrases if you are going to be working with people. Unless you are doing a professional placement like medicine no previous volunteering skills are required.
	
		 
	
		 
	
		
	
		
			Cambodia Gap Year FAQ
		
			
				Getting There: Cambodia is only a days drive from Bangkok and you can also fly with Air Asia fairly cheaply, this is a good country to visit if you would like to travel the loop around South-East Asia.
				 
			
				Visa: Depending on your Nationality you should be able to apply for a visa online in advance and be allowed entry into Cambodia as a tourist. 
		
		
			
				Safety: Cambodia is a very safe destination despite widespread poverty so don&#39;t let safety / crime put you off visiting. You will get to experience culture and really interact with locals who are really friendly and will greet you with smiles. 
		
		
			
				Budget: This is one of the best value destinations in the world and a lot cheaper than Thailand. There are cheap hotels, hostels and guest houses located throughout the country. Cambodia is a very cheap country to travel, possbily the cheapest in South-East Asia but always shop around for the best prices on trips and accommodation. Learn local phrases to barter for prices on the markets, some words like expensive and cheaper will come in handy. Also exchange your Reil before deparing, it can be a nightmare to exchange once outside of Cambodia.
				 
			
				Accommodation: Hotels and Hostels are fairly cheap in Cambodia and you really get what you pay for. On the cheapside you can get a bed in a dorm room for around £2.50 - £4 ($3 - $5), for mid range you can get a private hotel room for around £5 - £10 ($7 - $12) and if you spend more you will get en suite, color tv, air conditioning and a really good room. You should need to spend more than £15 - £20 per night to get a really good room.
		
		
			
				Food: The food in Cambodia is suprisingly tasty, expect rice, potatoes and meat in most cafes / restaurants. Don&#39;t be affraid to try something new whilst there are lots of Western food available too. We recommend visiting a local restaurant in Siem Riep and trying the Khmer curry which is really tasty, street food is good to eat and also cheap, you can view people cooking it in front of you so you will get an idea if anything takes your fancy. Some local Cambodian food delicacies can be a bit unusual, for example you can eat cooked spider!! if you are feeling adventurous maybe give it a try.
				 
			
				Crime / Safety - Cambodia has suffered from a terrible brutal past under the Pol Pot regime which is still fresh in the memory but this country is incredibly safe to visit and we highly recommend planning a trip. There are some dangers and annoyances to watch out for including pickpocketing which can be a problem in places like Phnom Penh. Always try to travel with someone especially at night and let others know where you are going if you are travelling off the beaten track. Try not to drink too much and try to find your way home too, be a responsible tourist. This might be one of the poorest countries in the world but local people are very friendly. 
				 
			
				Health & Safety: Yellow Fever is the only requirement for entry into Cambodia but there are others you might want to think about getting before departing. Others to think about getting include diphtheria and tetanus, hepatitis A / B, polio, rabies and typoid. Try to drink lots of bottled water in Cambodia, we don&#39;t advise to drink the tap water. Cambodia can get quite hot and humid during summer so its very important to stay hydrated. Malaria is a problem is some rural area&#39;s and so you might want to get medication, it is usually very rare for people to catch malaria in Cambodia though. You might also want to take a mosquito spray and net with you, sometimes you can get eaten alive by the insects in this country. Never have unprotected sex with a stranger or local person, its very common for local women to chat tourists up but always be aware they might want a fee, or have a disease. Always carry condoms with you and be on the safe side. If you have any serious medical problems whilst in Cambodia we recommend travelling to Thailand, Singapore or Hong Kong for treatment, here you will get a better level of healthcare and facilities. Always buy travel insurance so you are covered.
		
		
			 
	
	
		 
	
		Tips & Experiences - What to Expect from a Gap Year in Siem Riep
	
		My friend and I arrived in Cambodia after a month in Thailand, and there was a noticeable difference between the two countries as soon as we reached the border crossing. After the usual border control procedures we got in a taxi with another passenger (a talkative Australian man with a cowboy hat), and embarked on the journey towards Siem Reap – the gateway to the Angkor temples complex. It’s around a 3 hour ride on bumpy roads, and stands in stark contrast to the developed travel industry of Thailand, but it gets you to where you need to be. One tip is to limit the amount of water you consume as toilets did not feature on our excursion, except behind bushes. Many of the hotels in Siem Reap provide accommodation and transport deals to and from the Angkor temples, and your tuk-tuk driver will be waiting to take you there each morning. You can choose to get a 1 day, 3 day or week pass to explore the Angkor area; we opted for 3 days ($40) which was about right for us.

	Guide to Taking a Gap Year in France

	Ok, so you know you want to spend your precious gap year in Francce - you know a little bit of the language pretty well and you love the culture. As it’s extremely difficult to decide where to go and what to do when the world is your metaphorical oyster, you should be congratulated on narrowing down your chosen destinations to one! Whether you’ve decided to join a structured trip, or you’re more into the idea of a bohemian backpacking adventure, it’s probably a good idea to start your gap year off in a relaxed fashion. There are lots of cheap hostels available throughout the country in places like Paris but you might want to book yourself into a more expensive hotel somewhere for a few days can give you time to acclimatise and get ready for the next stage of your adventure. You’ll be surprised at how inexpensive you can find hostels and hotels, depending on when you book - if you go off season you could bag yourself a bargain and start your French gap year adventure off in style! But where do you go and what do you do? 

	 

	 

	

	Gap Year in Paris

	Paris is a city the young romantic dreams about. The perfect place to escape the hustle and bustle of the daily grind with your loved one. However, Paris’s allure doesn’t end at romance. Armed with a few friends, one change of clothes and a camera, Paris proves equally as enticing to the single traveller, as our featured travel writer Naomi Richardson found out by herself, below you can view here top 10 things to do on a gap year visiting or working in Paris...

	 

	1. Wander Down the Champs Elysees - The Champs Elysees. Think Oxford Street on acid. It’s big, it’s bold and it’s beautifully French. There’s the Arc de Triomphe at one end and La Grande Roue at the other, creating the perfect blend of modern and old. The street is littered with activities for the rich, ranging from designer shops to a Haagan Daaz restaurant.
	 

	2. Eat Croissants for Breakfast Everyday - As simple as this sounds, the croissants in Paris are second to none. Take this opportunity to explore different boulangeries and the variations on offer; once you’ve discovered your favourite you’ll never find one as perfect ever again.
	 

	3. Visit the Lovers Bridge - Regardless of one’s relationship status, the Lovers Bridge over the Seine River is a must-see in Paris. Spend a little while reading some of the messages and, if you feel so inclined add your own. The perfect reminder that romance isn’t dead.

	
	4. Go up the Eiffel Tower at night - Yes, The Eiffel Tower might be a little cliché, but if you head up once the sun has set the experience completely changes. The lights from Paris create the most incredible views and are well worth the queue time. If you’re feeling really flash, you could even purchase a glass of champagne at the top to celebrate the achievement of getting up there.
	 

	5. Listen to a Local Band - Even if you struggle to understand French, singing is still beautiful regardless of the language. Head over to a pub on the outskirts of the city, grab a drink and enjoy an evening of new music. You’ll be embracing everyday life of Parisians, rather than the classic tourist route.
	 

	6. Wander Around Paris After Midnight - As a city, Paris comes to life at night. The French adore their late night eating and partying and it would simply be rude not to join in. Wander the streets (in a group, of course) and soak in the party atmosphere – it’s a buzz you won’t get anywhere else.
	 

	7. Make a Picnic of all Things French - Head to the local supermarket and load up on baguettes, brie, Orangina and everything else you associated with France as a child. Find one of the many beautiful parks, settle down in the sun and people watch; the perfect activity to relax after running around the city.

	
	8. Visit the Louve and Other Attractions for Free - Many of the best tourist attractions in Paris are free for EU members between the ages of 18-25 – something I didn’t realise until my own visit. If you’re only there for a short time, some of the queues may put you off but it’s worth going into at least one of the landmarks; when else will you get to see the Mona Lisa for real?

	
	9. Go to as many Bars in the Latin Quarter as Possible - The Latin Quarter is well known for its bars and nightlife. What makes it special, however, is each bar is unique in its own way. We made our way around quite a few but became extremely fond of a particular one which we frequented two nights in a row. The staff are always incredibly friendly in each bar and revel chatting to foreigners, sharing stories of their own travels.

	
	10. Don&#39;t be afraid to venture outside of Central Paris - Yes, the Eiffel Tower and the Notre Dame are incredible. But they’re not the be all and end all of Paris. If you restrict yourself to the main attractions you miss out on the side street cafes, the smaller events occurring, the snippets of real life that occur in the city. Go for a wander and lose yourself in the beautiful city that is Paris.

	Best Places to Visit on a Gap Year in New Zealand

	Wellington - A relaxed capital city with a scenic red train, you can tour the parliament here

	Queenstown - The adventure capital of the world

	Wanaka - Mountains, scenery, skiing and a nice atmopshere

	Auckland - A sprawling city with lots of activity

	Roturua - The local hot springs are the attraction, this location can smell strong though!

	Off the Beaten Track - There are lots of other places too, don&#39;t be afraid to go off the beaten track e.g. Milford Sound, Invergargil and Napier. There are two giant glaciers - Franz Josef and Fox - that end only 250 metres above sea level. Be sure to also visit the blowhole at Punakaiki.

Waterfalls cascade hundreds of metres into the deep water and dolphins are the tour guides for kayakers. Fiordland National Park is a UNESCO World Heritage site and includes Milford Sound, which Rudyard Kipling called the eighth wonder of the world. Hiking is the best way to see more of the scenery and the area has three of New Zealand’s Great Walks. Hikers can go to Sutherland Falls, which is the tallest waterfall in the country.

This area is very secluded and visitors enjoy finding themselves alone among the thousands of wildflowers in Alexandra. The area includes the Moeraki boulders, which are 60 million years old perfect spheres.

	Dunedin - Known as the Edinburgh of New Zealand because of its Scottish heritage. The city has well-preserved Victorian and Edwardian architecture as well as one-of-a-kind wildlife habitats. The rarest penguins in the world are nearby as is the only mainland breeding colony of Royal Albatross in the world. The Larnach Castle is the only castle in New Zealand and is perched on a hill overlooking the Otago Harbour. Dunedin also has Cadbury World a chocolate factory with chocolate shop.

	Canterbury - There is no end to the activities in this part of South Island. Thrill seekers will be happy to never leave with bungy jumping, white water rafting, surfing and skiing all on the same day. The highest peak in the country, Aoraki Mount Cook as well as Arthur’s Pass National Park, both have excellent hiking activities. For a relaxing meal in a first class restaurant, visitors go to Christchurch - the Garden City. The buildings in the centre of the city were partially destroyed in an earthquake in 2011, but the welcoming locals and excellent city vibe has not been touched.

	Gap Year Tours & Backpacking in New Zealand

	New Zealand is built for backpackers and there are so many trips and places of interest to visit. On our website you can find gap year tours in New Zealand where you can travel both the North and South Islands, these types of trips are a great way to meet new people and see places you might not normally see travelling solo. Usually accommodation is included in the prices which vary depending on the tour you join. Local people speak English and so booking trips and transport is easy. You can pre-book tours, there are lots of trips with departures all year round. There are also other options like hiring a car, motorbike, campervan, catching public transport or joining overland hop on hop off bus trips which are very popular with gappers. If you like a town, city or place you can stay for as long as you like which is ideal for any gap year. If you want to see somewhere remote try to visit areas surrounding Dunedin in the South Island. St Clair beach is stunning and relatively un-touristy, you will not be disappointed if you enjoy relaxing on white sandy beaches.

	This country is a very easy country to navigate and ideally you&#39;ll need around a month to see as much as possible, it might be an idea to hire a car or meet people at a hostel to travel with if you are looking to get off the beaten track. On official trips you will be with experienced guides who know the best places to visit, they will be able to tell you lots of information you might not otherwise find out and can really improve your experience. This is one of the many highlights of booking an overland experience but try to book before departing as spaces can fill up quick. The public bus service is very reliable and will certainly be able to connect you to most towns and cities at low prices. If you hire a car or campervan its best to shop around for the best deal, also check notice boards in hostels as there are always travelers looking to sell their vehicles. There are also trains and internal flights but if you want to see as much as possible we don&#39;t really recommend these modes of transport. For trains check out Tranzrail or Jetstar Airlines / Air New Zealand for cheap flights.

	Top Tips for Taking a Gap Year in New Zealand

	
		General Information - If you allow around four weeks to visit New Zealand that should be enough to visit most of the main tourist attractions. Base backpackers in Auckland has a hot tub on the roof which has amazing views at night. The South Island is generally more fun and lively than the North, head to Queenstown for nightlife. Wanaka has amazing skiing and winter sports, it&#39;s also in a spectacular setting. Try to enter pool competitions at hostels, you can win amazing prizes like bunji jumps, trips and excursions.


	
		Renting Own Van - It&#39;s quite cheap to rent or buy a van and most of them have been adjusted by previous owners so that they now include a double bed and serve as a mobile home. And it´s quite handy that you don&#39;t have to build a tent after a long hiking day. Be careful where you intend to spend a night though, since most of the land is privately owned and the rest (parking lots, picnic spots) are being checked by local authorities that they´re not being used as a camping spot. But have a look at DOC campsites - these are some basic camping places where you can spend a night for free or for some minimum fee, they provide toilets and water, some of then even showers etc.


	
		Budget - If you are arriving from Europe or Australia you should find New Zealand cheaper than these destinations, things like buses and accommodation can be slightly cheaper. New Zealand is located a long way from anywhere and your best option for getting here might be a round the world ticket, sometimes this is just a little bit more expensive than a return flight. Try to avoid visiting during peak season where accommodation can be booked up in advance and more expensive than off peak. You will also find the main cities like Auckland and Wellington are more expensive than the rest of the country. Another money saving tip is a lot of hotels and hostels charge to use the internet and this can be expensive. An alternative is to visit the local library or go to a local coffee shop, lots now offer free wifi. There are lots of good deals you can get on bus trips to explore more of this country, lots of companies operate and you can also book in advance to save money. Also think to yourself how much you really want to and need to see, sometimes the day trips and excursions can end up costing more than the North / South island trip itself.
		 
	
		Accommodation - Accommodation is cheap, generally hostel dorms are your cheapest bet, they cost around £10 - £20 ($15 - $25 USD). If you are planning on staying somewhere for more than a few days you might also be able to work in the hostel in exchange for free accommodation, these types of hostels can be found but generally off season. Hotels are usually around £25 ($40) per night and again in the main cities this will be more expensive. You could also rent your own campervan, try couchsurfing or try a program like WWOOF which allow you to work in exchange for free accommodation. Recommended to book hostels and hotels in advance during peak season when most tourists visit. 
		 
	
		Food / Drink - This country is a very developed and there is a wide variety of food available. You can find cheap buffet restaurants like Chinese and Japanese and there are usually good deals on lunch offers. Eating dinner out can be expensive, expect to pay around £7 - £12 ($15) for most meals. There are a lot of fast food outlets which are cheap but even this can add up, it is also really unhealthy to eat this everyday. If you are going to stay in a hostel most have world class facilities and clean kitchens so you can prepare your own food. Our top recommendation is to find a local supermarket and buy your own food, this will save you a lot of money every week. Bars usually have great deals on beer during happy hour, usually around 4 - 7. Sometimes you can get a huge container with four beers in for less than the price you would pay for one normally. Expect to pay around £1.50 ($3) during happy hour and £3.50 ($5) out. Also if you are drinking alcohol on a daily basis this can eat away at your budget so try not to drink too much.


	
		
			Crime / Safety - New Zealand is the adventure capital of the world but please check you buy the right insurance policy, some do not cover dangerous and extreme sports. Please also apply lots of sunscreen, New Zealand has a thin ozone layer and has the worlds highest death rate from melanoma. Crime is relatively low but please be street wise and don&#39;t flash valuables in public. Always lock valuables in hotels and hostels. For emergencies dial 111 and you will be put through to the emergency services like the police, fire brigade and ambulance services. If calling from an international mobile phone please dial 112. Natives are extremely friendly and welcoming, you might want to get to know more the history of the islands and learn about Maori culture. 
	
	
		 
	
		 


	
		What to Expect
	
		English speaking natives who are very friendly, lots of adventure sports like bunji jumping, sky diving, glacier walks and more. New Zealand is quiet compared to Australia for example, the population of New Zealand is around 4 million which is smaller than London! Most people really enjoy travelling in New Zealand, the scenery made famous in the Lord of the Rings films is spectacular. Michelle from the Czech Republic had this to say about here time here "I´ve just came back from New Zealand and looking at the pictures that I´ve brought back I still envy myself that I&#39;ve been there."


	 

	 

	Past Participant Feedback

	Three years ago, Hannah Rose was in her fourth year of college decided she was going to find a way to mix her dreams with reality, she wanted to travel and explore but on her own terms. Hannah wanted to have an adventure and decided to take a gap year between college and the real world. Here she shares her successful three step plan to achieve your dream experience…

	"First I bought a ticket. A friend and I decided that we would gap year in New Zealand. We wanted to work so we needed a country that spoke English and would give us free visas with no hassle. Perfect. After deciding the where, I needed to figure out the how. Yeah I would work once I got to New Zealand, but how was I going to get there. I was a broke college student who heavily relied on her parents for income. I stopped eating out, partying as much and I saved. The moment I had enough for a one-way plane ticket, I bought one. I was once again broke but I had a ticket going somewhere and four months to find the money to make it happen. I moved in with my parents and took a summer job. I worked long hours, at a summer camp I didn&#39;t fancy too much, but it paid well and I got to be outside daily. It worked. 

	Second I made a plan. I&#39;m the girl who plans every step and every conversation that she will have over the next three days. I get anxious not knowing what I will be doing everyday of next week. So while being spontaneous when traveling is a great idea it will never be my reality. And while I know this about myself I also know that life doesn&#39;t work on a schedule, nor is a scheduled life a life at all. Now I had a ticket to a fantasy and an obstacle in the way. I fixed it. My friend and I made a plan. We created a list of everything we wanted to do, everywhere we wanted to visit. We gave ourselves two months to backpack, explore and WWOOF our way through the two islands. Hostel rooms were booked, couchsurfing accounts set up and WWOOFing arrangements made. Roughly two months into our trip we planned to settle down in Wellington and find jobs. I knew a family who lived their and could give us the stability I figured I would need by that point. I saved what I thought would be enough for two months of adventure and still have a sufficient amount to pay bond on a  decent apartment once in Wellington.

	Third I threw the plan out the window. On September 4, 2012 I boarded a plane with one friend, one backpack and one destination and flew around the world to the unknown kiwi land. Our first week followed our schedule and from their our trip unfolded. Six weeks into the trip I was done living out of a backpack, never showering and I was ready for a routine. While this might not sound thrilling and adventurous to some, it was just the adventure that I wanted. I spend ten and a half months based in Wellington getting to know the local culture, cuisine and people. I took side trip to explore what I hadn&#39;t yet seen and spent the rest of my time hiking and picnicking locally. I never held back and pushed myself just enough.

	When my visa ran out and I was forced to come home I was sad but so thankful. I had done the impossible. I had accomplished a dream of mine successfully and with no money. Throughout our youth we are constantly told to travel, to take advantages of our lives while we have no responsibility. To do it while we can. However being constantly told that the time is now, doesn&#39;t change the fact that traveling, moving or even trying something new is scary. It is. But it is worth it. My advice, do it, and do it your way. You can listen to people and get advice but when it comes down to it, it&#39;s your life and you jetting off. Make yourself comfortable and confident and then allow room for change. Take a look at what you want out of life and who you really are and what you want to be. Then find a way to combine it all.

	An island nation on the corner of the map; culturally akin to the Pacific Islands of Fiji, Samoa, and Tonga; dwarfed by that “other” Australasian country… yet on a scale our featured writer Leona Duff was completely unprepared for. Here she shares her experiences...

	Perhaps this speaks to my own naïvety, but being from England - urban England at that - I’ve been spoilt by our well-developed infrastructure and truly miniscule size. This is what I’ve come to appreciate in the short time I’ve been staying down under.

	I landed in Auckland just over two months ago, and as the country’s biggest city there was no cause for concern to start with. I knew I had to head down to Dunedin by the end of the week for work, on the south island – the south of the south island. If going by “land”; which was my choice having just got two long haul flights out of the way; this meant catching a ferry across the Cook Strait. When I asked at the office [of the host agency -support services for those like myself on working holiday visas] how this worked/how it would fit around the rest of the journey, I never thought it would involve booking hostels along the way.

	Three coaches, one sea voyage, five cities (with numerous rest stops along the way) = three days.

	An American might scoff at this, but it was new to me. Auckland to Wellington takes 12 hours alone, and it was there I stopped for the night. Early next morning, I caught the ferry to Picton (3 hrs), where the next coach met me to carry me to Christchurch (6 hrs). Another stopover before the final leg to Dunedin (& another 6 hrs). Granted, if you can drive yourself then you can take a more straightforward route, but it’s fair to say I saw a fair bit of the country in this time, with the landscape gradually changing from sub-tropical to temperate. I started adding to my list of places to visit - Taupo and Kaikoura particularly caught my eye. The list has only got longer since.

	This is where I should make note of the practical things: I travelled with Intercity Coaches (whose routes cover the length and breadth of the country), and Interislander Ferries (whose main competitor is Bluebridge). Public Transport is privatised in New Zealand, so there’s a vast array of companies with differing services, much of it localised. Now I’m in Dunedin, I’ve learned that Atomic Shuttles are the cheapest to go with for travelling between here, Christchurch, Queenstown, and Invercargill. The only passenger trains between cities are run by Kiwi Rail, and these are on very restrictive routes. Each of these options is also limited by frequency (usually twice a day) and space. To get to the more remote areas, which – let’s face it – are what this country is famed for, you have to hope there’s a tour company offering packages through your area of interest.

	Basically, it’s a country where it really pays to know how to drive. I’ve never needed to before (and I’ve not quite worked my way up to hitchhiking, despite how safe the country is considered). Even then, the roads are of a slightly different nature than you might be used to. Void of traffic, yes, but if you venture away from the highways then you’re likely to be facing some very gravelly surfaces. But then, that’s got something of a romanticism all its own.

There are lots of amazing gap year programs in the Philippines - this is the perfect country if you are looking for a less touristy destinations compared to others in South-East Asia. Expect spectacular beaches - some to rival Australia for the best in the world, lots of wildlife, big cities and options for students, graduates and those looking for a fresh experience. View our guide to taking a gap year in the Philippines below.


	

	Guide to Taking a Gap Year in the Philippines

	When visiting The Philippines you will probably fly into Manila which is a huge city, there isn&#39;t that much to see and do here do try to get out and see the rest of the country. If you have some spare time going to the mall is really the main distraction you can find in Manila by day-time once you have been to the very few touristy places! But not all malls are equals. The "Mall of Asia", the third largest mall in the world (the two bigger ones are in China) and its a different way to spend an afternoon watching local people buy goods. Recommended destinations to check out on a gap year in The Philippines include Cebu, Borocay, Bohol and Palawan. Safety shouldn&#39;t be a problem, you should be able to take local busses without any problems but always try to travel with someone and keep an eye on your belongings.

	 

	Top Places to Visit

	
		Manila, its a big sprawling city and you will most likely fly into here. Try to visit the famous mall which is the 3rd biggest in the world!
	
		The Rice Terraces in the Center of North Luzon are spectacular
	
		Borocay has some amazing beaches with pure white sand
	
		Malapascua island which has lots of dive sites and centres which offer beginners courses
	
		Banaue is an impressive city to see in person and its easily accessed by bus
	
		One Hundred Islands National Park


	 

	Budget

	Some things can add to the price of your gap year, island hopping is an amazing experience but this will hit your budget. Accommodation on islands like Borocay will be more expensive than other less touristy destinations. Accommodation is generally priced at £1 - £5 for a dorm bed, a private / double hostel room will cost around £5 - £10 per night whilst a hotel room is priced around £15 - £25. You can also stay in guest houses, home stays, beach bungalows or if you are really trying to save money try a website like Couch Surfing. Food and drink in The Philippines is very cheap, you can eat street food for less than £1! Fast food outlets, cafes and restaurant food shouldn&#39;t be any more than £3 - £8.

	 

	Past Gapper Feedback

	“Now I am slightly biased here in that my family is from Cebu (although I was born and reside in England) BUT I promise you it is such a beauteous island with the most accommodating people you are likely to encounter dare I say, anywhere in the world. Well I spend the majority of my time in Cebu city itself due to family. I would highly recommend this if you crave a real sense of the ‘true’ Philippines.”

	What to Do on a Gap Year in Singapore

	One of our featured writers Sally Taylor recently visited Singapore and below she shares her tips and experiences for what you can do in this destinations...

	With only 2 days in Singapore, and 1 of those dedicated to indulging my inner child at Universal Studios, I had a mission: to see as much as possible in just 24hours! The good news? It&#39;s definitely doable; you&#39;ll get a real sense of the playful but uber-modern Asian vibe of this city-state in no time at all. The bad news? You&#39;ll find it hard to leave so soon! I could have happily spent another day or two here, and have included some suggestions at the bottom if you have more time to play with (lucky you!).

	Firstly, getting there. While you could fly, the easiest and often cheaper way is to take the bus. It&#39;s coach travel, but not as you know it! We got a super comfy, air conditioned coach, with copious leg room and even DVDs playing, for less than the cost of a budget flight. It takes around 4-5 hours from downtown Kuala Lumpur, though it&#39;s best not to  any connections too close to your expected arrival time, as immigration, traffic or the number of toilet stops your driver decides to make can all bump up the time! Crossing the border is easy - your driver will tell you what to do and when, just be sure to get back on the right coach! At the first checkpoint you just have your passport stamped, then at the second you put your bag through a scanner. Much less hassle than airport security!

	The main bus terminal is on Beach Road, and there&#39;s an MRT stop (Nicoll Highway) less than 10 minutes walk away to take you into the city. There&#39;s no ATM there though, so grab some dollars when you get off the bus. Like in Hong Kong and Kuala Lumpur, the MRT is fantastic: easy, fast and frequent. A single trip is around $1.30.  We stayed in Chinatown where there are a lot of accommodation options very near the MRT, from bustling backpackers to flashy five stars. It being near to Chinese New Year this vibrant district was even more colourful, with giant decorations and lanterns lining the streets. There are hundreds of well-priced places to eat, as well as supermarkets nearby.

	The next day my sightseeing mission began with a free walking tour of the city&#39;s Little India. You don&#39;t have to book, just head to The Verge shopping centre for 10am (opposite the Little India MRT stop) to meet your guide. Ours was June, a very enthusiastic and knowledgeable Singaporean who was full of facts and anecdotes about this buzzing district. Even if you don&#39;t make the tour, be sure to visit the area; having stayed in a few different Chinatowns (including, err, actual China) it was really exciting to immerse ourselves in all things Indian.   Shopfronts hung with gorgeous saris and flower garlands, piles of fragrant spices and booming Bollywood tunes - it&#39;s an assault on the senses! The tour lasted around 2 hours - be sure to do the polite thing an tip your guide when you leave!

	After the tour we hopped back on the MRT to Orchard Road, Singapore&#39;s shopping mecca. It&#39;s a seemingly never ending avenue of fancy department stores and shopping malls that are architectural wonders in themselves, and window shopping is a great way to work up an appetite for lunch! Eating on Orchard itself comes at a premium, but a little nosing around inside one of the many malls and you&#39;ll find lots of cafes and food courts to choose from.

	After a quick bowl of laksa (delicious!) we took the MRT to Esplanade, and one of Singapore&#39;s best known sites, the famous Raffles hotel. Named after the fantastically-named Sir Thomas Stamford Bingley Raffles, the founder of Singapore, this beautiful colonial style hotel has been open since 1899. Tourists are welcome to wander around some areas, but if you want a drink at the bar be sure to dress nicely! It&#39;s also not far to walk from Raffles to Marina Quay to see the Merlion, the half lion, half mermaid statue that is the symbol of Singapore, and marvel at the impressive skyline.

	We had dinner in Chinatown then walked to Clarke Quay, though there is an MRT stop and plenty of restaurants there too. Clarke Quay is where Singapore goes for a night out, with all different kinds of bars (including the ubiquitous Irish pub) lining both sides of the waterfront. If you&#39;re after a Singapore Sling, which of course we were, be sure to shop around! It would&#39;ve set us back nearly $25 at Raffles, but we found a bar overlooking all the action at Clarke Quay where they were buy one get one free. And very tasty they were too!

	So concluded our 24 hours of sightseeing. I would hugely recommend a visit to Universal Studios, on Singapore&#39;s playground, Sentosa Island, where we spent our second day. Again just a couple of MRT stops way, get there early and stay til the parade at 6pm (at least!). If I&#39;d had longer I would have loved to visit the new River Safari, a waterbourne wildlife experience where you can see pandas, manatees and a whole host of other rare creatures. I&#39;d also have checked out the Night Safari (can you tell I like animals?) which does as it says on the tin, taking you on a night time tour to see everything from bats to big cats up close after hours. Sentosa Island also has 4 or 5 other theme parks to check out, if your inner child isn&#39;t tired yet!

	A fantastic flying visit that left me hungry for more - thank you Singapore!

	Safety Advice & Local Laws

	One last and final step revolves around the beautiful city of Singapore, which is infamous for its clean nature. On the spot fines are common, especially from some behaviours that we tolerate here in Britain, so make sure you aren’t caught chewing gum on the trains or littering. And not to take the sparkle out of the Asian jewel, nor to assume that these behaviours are something that travellers may take part in, but it’s worth mentioning that the death penalty is in use for offences that include murder and drug trafficking.

	Why Take a Gap Year in Spain

	Gap years are more than just a few months in a place you choose to work or study. With incredible access to all corners of the country, including some more distant island paradises; experiencing the marvel that is a Spanish holiday is made infinitely easier thanks to proximity and connectedness. There will never be a better time to jet off to Tenerife for a long weekend in the Canary Islands or explore the rugged mountains of Extremadura. Experience the Ibiza nightlife or run with the bulls in Pamplona for a taste of the wilder side, or retreat to the beautiful Basque countryside for cooking classes and other cultural activities. Gap years are an incredible way to really indulge the amazing adventures of youth between serious stints as a student or full time employee. Choosing the perfect destination is no easy feat.

	Gap Year Jobs in Spain

	If you’re after a steady gap year job then there are plenty of options for you, during which you’ll be able to immerse yourself in Spanish culture and perfect your Spanish speaking skills. If you need to work while you’re away, it can be a good idea to secure a position somewhere and spend a few months there, before taking the opportunity to backpack around for a few months. For many students, this would be the ideal mix of work and travel, all the while enabling them to fund it themselves and experience something completely different.

	It’s possible to work your way around the country in hospitality, for example. There are many websites that will help you get a waitressing, catering or bar job somewhere in Spain, which can then kick start your year of adventuring. It is possible to pick up casual work this way and fund your adventures backpacking. If teaching is your thing, then you could find a place teaching English to adults or children, again there are plenty of programmes to help you find these. You will most likely need a TEFL qualification and once you have this it will also open up many avenues to you for further travel in the future. Positions can be found at language schools, summer camps and leading private lessons.

	 

	 

	Backpacking in Spain

	Spain is a great country to learn to surf or live for a longer period and take part in an exciting gap year program, each area of the country offers a different experience, you could experience one of the many great year round festivals, spend time exploring cities or even travel through more countries overland in this region. Some people head South to Morocco whilst you can also join trips on a gap year in Portugal. A lot of people learn Spanish in Spain, there are Spanish classes and language schools in places like Barcelona, Madrid, Valencia, Málaga, Salamanca and Seville.

	These are just a few of the activities on offer though, you could volunteer or join an organised overland adventure trip. On our website we have featured gap year programs available which can be joined all year round. For these you will usually need to pay a fee which covers placements, transfers, accommodation and meals for the duration of your stay. To apply for a gap year program you will need to be eligible for a tourist visa, most Nationalities are able to apply. It is best to book a couple of months in advance to, this is a popular year round destination and spaces can fill up quickly.

	It’s best to do a lot of research and planning before leaving on your gap year, take note of working requirements for example, and cover your communications well. Making sure you have a good data roaming plan on your phone is a good idea, as you can get caught out with huge bills just for hopping online a couple of times. Being safe is just as important as being adventurous so make sure you’re always in contact with someone back home if you’re travelling alone, or get a group together of trusted companions for extra safety - and fun!

	Spain Gap Year FAQ

	
		Visa: If you come from the UK you can enter Spain for free as this country is an EU member state, all you need is a valid passport. If you are visiting from outside of the EU you will need to check to see if you are eligible for a tourist visa
		 
	
		Airports: Most cities in Spain are connect to airports in Europe and destinations worldwide. You can get really cheap flights with low cost airlines if you book in advance.
		 
	
		Accommodation: There are a high standard of hotels, hostels and guest houses located throughout the country, prices are quite cheap in comparison with other European destinations. Spanish accommodation is medium priced, generally a hostel dorm bed will cost you around £10 ($15) per night, if you go in winter or out of summer you will pay less. Try to book accommodation well in advance as its much cheaper. A private room in a hostel or hotel will cost you around £25 - £40 ($35 - $50) per night and it really depends on where you are. In Barcelona, Madrid and Valencia are more expensive than smaller towns and cities. An idea if there is a couple of you travelling, instead of staying in a dorm book a twin room this sometimes is cheaper especially if you stay more than a few days. 
		 
	
		Cost: Spain is a very good value for money destination, accommodation, food, transport and sightseeing. The more expensive places include Barcelona and Madrid which are the two main cities. One of your biggest costs will probably be drinking alcohol so if you can avoid / cut back on this you will save a lot of money. You will probably spend less money on a gap year in Spain than other countries in Europe, accommodation and food seem cheaper and there are lots of way to save money. Some places in Spain are a lot more expensive than others, for example IIbiza during summer can cost you a  fortune, hotels, food, drink and going out is really high. Whilst other destinations like Benidorm are a lot cheaper.
		 
	
		Food & Drink: Spain has some of the best food in Europe, there are usually great deals on lunch time where restaurants cut the prices. Try the local paella and seafood you won&#39;t be disappointed. Spain has really tasty food, paella is a local favorite but isn&#39;t to everyone tastes. Expect to pay around £5 - £10 for a meal in a restaurant ($7 - $12). Please note if you get drinks, beer or cocktails with your food you can easily spend £20 ($25). If you are looking for cheap food out, lunch is your best bet, most of the Spanish people eat really late at night so restaurants can be busy and overpriced. During lunch there are usually good deals on meals with rates slashed. If you are looking to save as much money as possible then get your food at supermarkets or local markets, you could make sandwiches and fruit which will work out a lot cheaper than eating our everyday.
		 
	
		Transport: Spain has a quick and efficient transport network meaning you can travel throughout the country relatively easily. Transport is fairly cheap but you have to remember how big a country Spain is, we recommend taking the bus to get around which will save you a lot of money but the journey time will be longer. Buses are safe and there are also cheap overnight services. Trains are quick but very expensive. The metro in cities is cheap too compared to cities like London, usually a single trip costs around £1 - £1.50 ($1 - $3). You can also join a gap year tour


	
		Health & Safety: Spain is a very modern country and has world class hospital and health facilities but please always buy travel insurance to be on the safe side. There are no specific vaccinations you will need to enter Spain. Petty theft and pick-pocketing is a problem in some places in Spain, be careful around tourist hot spots like La Rambla in Barcelona always keep an eye on your belongings. On party islands like Ibiza burglaries are a problem, try to keep important belongings like your passport and money in a safe in reception. When there are festivals and celebrations like New Year always keep your bag / camera in sight, lots of people watch fireworks for example and then open their bag to find belongings gone.

	What to Expect from Taking a Gap Year in Sri Lanka

	Sri Lanka is a truly beautiful nation where you can find so much diversity in nature, architecture and culture within only a few hundred kilometres. Read what you can expect from traveling in Sri Lanka from our featured travel writer Dean Bennell...

	Colombo is a busy, bustling and jam-packed city where the traffic is never light and people are always on the move. Yet within it’s circle you will find shanty towns through to expensive apartments and glorious hotels set within the old colonial walls of the Dutch and the English. In this busy city you can still find a coastline to watch the sunset from, with locals thriving on the community feel of life on the sea wall. Travel a few hundred kilometres north to cities such as Polonnaruwa and you will find ancient city ruins, tucked aside next to a thriving new town - a real mixture of the best of both worlds. From here you have national parks only down the road and a whole host of local towns and villages, packed with culture, community and history. The beauty of Sri Lanka really comes alive in the hill country, where Kandy (considered Sri Lanka’s ‘second city’) is found, tucked away amongst vast forests and tea plantations. From here you can visit sanctuaries and a whole host of temples and statues. Head south of Colombo and you will see a whole new natural world; beautiful beaches and countryside, still feeling the effects of the 2004 tsunami, but still adapting a different feel to Sri Lanka altogether.

	Yet the best thing about Sri Lanka is it’s people. The people here are driven by their beliefs but also driven to work incredibly hard, at a time where many in the whole world are reeling from the current economic climate. In the United Kingdom, it can be safe to say that many people do not realise how lucky they truly are. How lucky we all are to have a supportive state system - such as the NHS, social housing and welfare. How lucky we are to live in a country that is a world leader in terms of human development, supported by vast organisations, propped up by multinational companies and in turn, allowing the people to live in luxury in comparison to poorer world nations. The words ‘third world country’ have been dotted about by some UK residents during it’s struggle through recession but to those that tend to write to their local newspaper and complain to local councillors about things like pot holes, waiting two hours at a walk-in surgery or moaning about only two million pounds being spent on a bus station - they seem to be lost, sadly, and forget about those in the UK that are truly in need as most people just walk on by with their heads down worrying about their own needs. We are lucky to even have anything.

	The roads in Sri Lanka are chaotic and pot hole ridden. The journeys take hours. The hospitals, doctors and dentists are only for those who can afford it. There is no red tape, no health and safety - just common sense and community. Despite many living in poverty, begging on the streets, the Sinhalese are perhaps the nicest and kindest people that I could ever meet. My companion on my travels has a prosthetic limb and the kind-hearted treatment that he receives from everybody is truly inspirational; and I have never seen anything like it. Locals tell us that many lost their limbs during the thirty year civil war here and something like that is even more life-changing and agonising out here as they do not have the same facilities as we do at home - we are lucky to have systems such as the NHS and the opportunity to receive such help when we need it most.

	They help each other make money, always looking out for their colleagues and friends and if you have any illness, disability or need, rich or poor, every single person will help you. We have lived in a pampered nation which seems to have taken us away from the true meaning of community. You look at Sri Lanka in all it’s beauty and you see streets full of people smiling, chatting and laughing, working together to help themselves - despite the tough conditions in which they live. They work twelve hours a day for very little, yet they get on with life and work for their friends, family and community. They are a people that many should take for example and life seems to be much more simple than the serious nature in which the UK does. As a place to visit, Sri Lanka is truly inspirational and never would I have thought I would have such an eye-opening experience, in terms of what there is to see and do but mostly the people that live here. Asia is an awe-inspiring continent and a beautiful contrast to our own world that certainly lives behind a smoke-screen for most.

Gap Year in the United Kingdom

	The UK (Great Britain) is an appealing gap year destination for so many reasons, you will meet new people, get to experience a unique culture, learn about the history of the country and enjoy the world class arts and entertainment. We have put together a guide to taking a gap year in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - below you can read more information and get top tips to get you prepare. We have working holiday jobs, internships, study abroad programs or you could just explore the country on an overland tour. Also if you have ever dreamed about spending a gap year in London you can turn this into a reality today, we have jobs and internships available to join throughout the year. Start planning the most amazing adventure of your life.


	Why a gap year in your own backyard could be the alternative to a cliched &#39;GapYah!&#39;

	What do you think when you hear the term ‘Gap Year’? Travelling, backpacking, full-moon parties, dodgy stomachs? The chances are, you’re thinking a fresh-faced British teen in a far- flung land. That’s the generally-accepted perception – a chance for school leavers to visit a foreign country, let loose and drink to excess after breaking free from the restrictions of school life. I’m not for one minute writing to advocate against this. I enjoy visiting different countries and getting some sunshine as much as the next guy.

	Having said that, with the now notorious ‘gap yah’ viral video still rippling across British sixth forms and colleges, more and more people are growing cynical about travelling miles and miles abroad to ‘find themselves’. And the near daily headlines of graduates facing long-term unemployment, despite sending in hundreds of CVs with stellar academic achievements, suggest that young people can no longer afford these hedonistic and purposeless trips that amount to extended holidays.  

	For those who want to make a sustained change in a community, a trip to build a school on a gap year in Africa seems high in self-interest but low in genuine help for people living in need.  Speaking to friends who volunteered in Fiji, the questions were unanimous: ‘do we actually know if anyone wanted that?’ and ‘what was that for again?’ Yet, this enthusiasm to ‘make a difference’ is real and heartfelt. So the question is: in  2013, can you take a gap year where you really have an impact helping a community that need it, learn about a different culture, improve your employability and have some fun along the way without being a complete cliché?   

	The short answer is ‘yes’.  

	There are so many organisations encouraging young people to spend their gap year in the United Kingdom. Why at home? Because we face complex social issues that need the energy and creativity of smart young people. Search our gap year options for the UK and apply today.

		Getting to the UK
	
		Cheap to London are available from almost every major airport and airline in the world, now is the time to plan that London trip or holiday you have always wanted. Most London airports are connected to international airports around the world. If you live in Europe you are best catching a service like RyanAir, EasyJet or WizzAir. These offer cheap flights into Luton, Gatwick and Stanstead. From Europe you can also catch a bus service like Megabus or National Express which connect most cities in Europe.
	
		If you live in Europe or even around the world you can get great deals on flights to the United Kingdom. There are lots of airports you can fly into and it really depends on what area of the country you would like to visit for which the best airport to fly into is. An alternative to flying is to either drive, join a tour or book a coach trip. If you live outside of Europe you are best booking flights in advance for the best deals. The summer period from May - September is usually most expensive time to visit so avoid this period if you are looking to travel on a budget.
	
		 
	
		Weather & Best Time to Visit
	
		The weather in the UK is notoriously wet and rainy. Try visiting during summer - May to August where you will get to hopefully see some sun. Visiting during Christmas and New Year is also a lot of fun, the country is lit up with festive street lights and decorations.
	
		 
	
		Budget
	
		You can expect to spend around £30 - £100 per day in the UK depending on what level of luxury you are looking for. If you stay in a hotel this can be your biggest cost, food and drink will cost around £15 per day and sightseeing optional extras will be more.
	
		 
	
		Cost of Accommodation
	
		The United Kingdom has notoriously high hotel and hostel prices compared to the rest of the world. You can save money by booking in advance or booking a lastminute deal. London and Edinburgh have some of the highest prices for the accommodation in the UK but generally the rest of the country is a lot cheaper. A hotel room will cost around £50 per night in the United Kingdom, this will be more around £100 in London. Hostel dorm beds are usually around £10 - £25 per night. If you are travelling with someone else it might be cheaper to get a hotel room rather than a private room in a hostel. If you are planning on staying more than a few days and are looking to travel on a shoestring you might want to consider a website like Couchsurfing. For long term stays you might want to consider houseshares which you can usually find through contacts, friends and websites like the Gumtree.
	
		 
	
		Transport & Getting Around
	
		There is an extensive rail and bus network meaning the whole country is very accessible. To get the best deals on rail fares you will need to book in advance as if you get tickets on the day it will be more expensive. Megabus offer cheap rail journeys in the UK if you travel Monday to Friday, you will need to book around 2-3 weeks in advance to get the cheapest fares. If you want to travel independently you could hire a car but please note petrol prices in the UK are very expensive. If you are looking to learn more about the country and would like to take some of the stress away you could join tours in the United Kingdom. The cheapest way to travel around the UK is via coach, there are several operators including National Express and Megabus. Throughout the year they have special offers on bus routes and you can travel for as little as £1. The journey time will be longer than taking the train but it will be a lot cheaper.
	
		 
	
		Food and Drink
	
		There is an international mix of food available in the UK so you will be sure to find something to match your tastes. To save money on food and drink whilst in the UK you can visit visit supermarkets for sandwiches and fresh food. It is a lot cheaper to make your own food as there are compatative prices on food with lots of chains available including Tesco, Sainsburys, Aldi, Liddle and Iceland. For eating out find the Wetherspoon chain of pubs which offers cheap pub food. Fast food outlets generally costs around £5 per meal, and the price of a pint of beer costs around £3.50 which can soon eat away at your budget.
	
		 
	
		
	
		Gap Year in London
	
		When you think of London, what do you think of? The Tower of London? Big Ben? Westminster Abbey? London is a lively and vibrant city that is filled with shops, historical sites and far more. While it can be pricey to visit the UK capital, it is possible to have a great holiday in London on a tight budget especially if you book flights in advance. Indeed, the more you can save on your flight, the more you have to spend on other things such as souvenirs. London is both the capital of England and the largest city you can visit on a gap year in the UK. This city is one of the most popular city destinations in the world, millions of people visit every year and this is also a popular stop off for gappers from countries like Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.
	
		Surprisingly enough, London is also very compact, making it easy to get around on foot and on the Underground network. There are eight million people living in London proper, although that number increases to 14 million when you factor in those commuting from the suburbs. It is one of the most recognised cities in the World and it has been a hub of culture, fashion, trade, finance and politics for centuries. London is full of things to see and enjoy. It is also considered a fairly safe city; nevertheless, a degree of common sense should be exercised when it comes to protecting yourself. Double-decker buses and the Underground make it easy to get around, and you will find many shopping centres intermingled with small store fronts that make you feel like you have stepped into a Charles Dickens novel. It is one of the cities in the World everyone must experience once in their lifetime.
	
		Getting around London is very easy, there is an extensive tube service and also buses, taxis and bikes available for hire. We recommend buying an Oyster card when you arrive into London, this is £5 and gives you discounted travel. You can also get the £5 back when you depart London. London is safe city to visit, stick to the main tourist trail and you should not have any problems. In an emergency dial 999 or for non urgent problems you can dial 111.
	
		 
	
		Getting from London Airports to the City Centre
	
		London airports include Heathrow, Gatwick, Stanstead and Luton. There are lots of ways to get from these airports to the city centre for all budgets. You can catch taxis which is the most expensive way and not always the quickest. Always remember to get the official rank, don&#39;t trust anyone who approaches you for a lift and usually you can get overcharged. 
	
		Stanstead airport is quite far from Central London it takes about an hour by train and longer by bus. You can buy a train ticket in advance for cheaper or also just turn up at the station which is a short walk from the departure lounge. There are also buses which are cheaper. 
	
		From Heathrow airport you can catch the tube which is our best recommendation, buy an Oyster card at the ticket office which will save you money on the public transport system in London. Heathrow is in zone 6 in South-West London and it will take about an hour to reach the centre of London.
	
		From Gatwick airport you can catch a train, either a public service or the Gatwick express which can get you to London in around 30 minutes. This is a very easy journey to complete.
	
		For Luton airport we recommend catching the Easybus or paying for the bus, Luton is outside of London but the route by motorway is very easy.

Gap-Year Planning - Advice & Guidance
Gap-Year Planning - Advice & Guidance from Projects Abroad Staff... Planning your gap-year should be a huge task; if it isn’t, then you probably aren’t doing it correctly. But where on Earth do you start...?
Well don’t worry because the Projects Abroad staff are coming to your aid with this helpful Gap-Year Planning guide! We can’t promise you that it covers absolutely every eventuality, and it certainly won’t be able to book any flights for you, but it might just set you off on the right track.

Gap Year Planning: Working out your Itinerary

Budget
First thing’s first – you need to work out how much money you have available to spend. Whether you are going to be dipping into your savings, earning the money in the first half of your gap-year, or going cap-in-hand to your parents, you need to be realistic about how much you are going to have, because this will be vital in determining both how long you are going to be able to go away, and what your expected standard of living is going to be whilst you are away.

Destination
Once you know how much money you have, you are going to want to work out where you want to go. If you are reading this page then it is probably because you want to spend part of your gap-year volunteering on one of our projects, in which case you can click on the Projects section at the top of the page; that way you can choose a type of project and see where exactly we run this type of project. Alternatively you may already have a destination in mind, in which case you can click on the Destinations section; then you can find out the projects that are available there. We also have information on travel and tourism opportunities, both within the chosen destination and beyond.

Volunteering Costs
If you are planning on volunteering, it would be a good idea to sort this out first. You do not have to commit to anything at this early stage but working out in your own head what you want to do, where, and when will make the rest of the plans fit into place much more easily. A good place to start is to take a look at our Prices page, by clicking the link at the top of the screen. Remember that our prices include your accommodation, food and insurance for the time that you are volunteering.

Flights
Your flight costs are going to be another big expense and should therefore be worked out at the beginning. Again, you don’t have to commit any money at this stage (in fact we would ask you not to confirm flights relevant to your volunteering period until you have received full acceptance from us that we have a place for you) but getting an idea of how much you are going to be required to spend is going to help immensely. If you wish, Projects Abroad can sort out your flights for you; the advantage of this is that you let us do all that hard work (you can find out more by clicking on the Prices link at the top of the page and then selecting “Flight Prices” from the left-hand menu bar). Or you may be getting a “Round-the-World” ticket. Or you may be able to use collected “Air Miles” to reduce the cost of a ticket. There are many options and it can be a minefield, but take time to look around and you will reap the rewards!

Transportation
When you have planned out the air-travel, you are probably going to want to work out the overland travel possibilities. There is unlikely to be too many things that you can book in advance – perhaps only the odd lengthy train or boat journey – but what you want to work out is whether it is actually both possible and realistic to cover the distances between flights in the time you have set yourself. To do this it is advisable to get hold of a comprehensive, up-to-date travel guide.

A classic mistake is to plan so much travelling that you forget to schedule in time to actually see the places you are arriving in! On the other hand a skilful trick – which is particularly helpful for those people on a tight budget – is to schedule night buses and trains in for long journeys; this way you save money that you would have spent on accommodation. Please consider the safety of travelling by night in certain destinations and avoid travelling alone at night. If you do decide that you are going to book a ticket in advance, then do your best to ensure that the ticket is flexible; gap-year travelling can be unpredictable and you don’t want to change your plans but then find that you can’t change your ticket.

Visas
So you know where you want to go, when you want to go there and that this plan is achievable. Your only real remaining logistical barrier is getting your visas sorted out for your destination countries. If you are a British citizen you are very lucky, in that you can travel to a number of countries without getting a visa in advance. But there are still many countries where it is not so easy, and every country’s rules are different. Projects Abroad will be able to assist you in obtaining a visa for the destinations that you are volunteering in; this process takes place after you have been accepted. Please be aware that some countries will charge for a visa.

Accommodation
The last major part of your itinerary will be looking at where you are going to be staying, as this will be a major part of your daily costs. On a gap-year you are probably going to be looking at “budget” accommodation for the most part, and the basic hostel dorm-room is about as budget as you are going to get.

However there may be days in your itinerary when you want a little bit more comfort or security – say, for example, if you arrive in a new location late at night. In these circumstances it is often advisable to book in advance. Advance bookings can usually be made by phone or online. In fact, you may find – as the internet becomes increasingly accessible to people in the developing world – that you will book more and more of your accommodation online. Please remember that all your accommodation requirements are included for the duration of your Projects Abroad placement.

Gap Year Planning: Important Considerations

Travel Insurance
Even if you are on a very tight budget, do not consider leaving the country without travel insurance! There are all manner of different types of cover and it is important that you understand what they are offering; the best way to do that is to simply start looking! For the duration of your volunteering placement you will be covered by Projects Abroad’s own insurance, and we can extend this to fit your dates if you require us to. But if not, please ensure that you find a suitable policy - one which includes cover for any activities you are planning on doing, such as horse-riding, white-water rafting, etc.

Immunisations and Vaccinations
If you have never travelled out of Europe before, there are likely to be a number of jabs that you definitely should get, and a few more besides that would be highly recommended. Some of these may be given as part of a programme, over the course of a number of weeks. For this reason it is advisable that you get in touch with your GP as soon as possible. They will also be able to give you advice about protecting yourself against malaria, if you are going to be entering a malaria-risk zone.

Medication and Repeat Prescriptions
If you are taking any medication you will need to speak with your GP about obtaining enough to last you throughout the period you are away, as you may not always be able to get hold of exactly what you require overseas. The same applies to things like disposable contact lenses.

Staying in Contact
It is becoming increasingly easy to remain in close contact with friends and family whilst travelling, but you still need to put a little bit of thought into it – not all mobile phones will work in all countries for example, so you will probably want to check with your mobile network. One of things we actively encourage our volunteers to do when they arrive overseas is to purchase a local SIM card so they can contact other volunteers cheaply, but you should consider using your old SIM card when calling people back home, just make sure before you go that you know how much you will be paying to do so.

Many people also like to set up some sort of ‘blog’, so they can update people on what they are doing without having to write lots of individual emails. And always remember – people still love receiving postcards!

Make Photocopies
You don’t want to risk losing important information like your insurance details, Projects Abroad staff phone numbers, the phone number of the hotel that you will be staying at when you first arrive, etc. So make copies of everything, ideally one to leave with a trustworthy, easily contactable person back home, and one for you to carry around in a separate bag to the originals.

In many countries you will be expected to carry some form of identification at all times, and failure to produce at least a photocopy of both the main page of your passport (the page with the photograph of you on it) and your visa card/stamp when asked to by a police officer can lead to problems.
Gap-Year Planning: Packing

The old piece of advice concerning packing for travelling is that you should get together everything you think you are going to need, lay it out on the floor, and throw half of it away. Though probably not wise to follow this to the exact letter, it does demonstrate the point that you rarely need or use as much as you think you will.

Of course everybody is different and nobody can tell you exactly what you should and shouldn’t be taking. But most people find that the best recipe for success is “variety”; pack to cover lots of different eventualities, but make sure you don’t pack too many things which cover the same eventuality! For example, what is the point in taking 10 different T-shirts when you can take 3 and a bottle of travel detergent?

It is important to realise that many of the things that you are considering buying for your trip can be easily purchased – often at a much lower price – overseas. But there are a number of key items that you might want to consider, such as: a universal electrical plug adaptor, a universal sink plug (they do exist!), a ball of string (always useful for impromptu washing lines), a sewing kit and a sleeping bag liner or duvet cover (much lighter than a sleeping bag, but affords you protection from dirty mattresses). To help you tailor your packing to your chosen Projects Abroad destination, we will provide you with a kit-list once we have set you up with your personalised “My Projects Abroad” webpage.

Gap Year Safety – Advice & Guidance
With around 30% of our volunteers being either on their gap years or of gap-year age, gap-year safety is a subject we take very seriously. We have over 17 years of experience dealing with volunteers from this age-group and our overseas staff are thoroughly trained to be aware of the dangers posed to young volunteers. It is their responsibility to keep volunteers as safe and well-versed in these dangers as it is possible to be, for the duration of their time away with us and beyond.
It is natural that parents want to ensure that their son or daughters knows as much about the risks involved as possible before they leave home, which is why we have put together this handy resource – a bank of advice, hints, tips and guidance from the staff of Projects Abroad – for our Gap-Year travellers. We have all been in the same situation at some point (although for some of us that point feels like an awfully long time ago!) and have also seen successive years of Gap-Year travellers going away with us, so we hope this will be of some help.
Gap-Year Safety: Before you go

There are a vast number of gadgets and pieces of equipment that are geared towards traveller safety, but you cannot pack them all, and therefore it pays to take a little time to really think about what you are going to need.

    * A medical kit is always going to be at the top of your list; there are all manner of different ones available and you should look to purchase one which includes the type of equipment and medications which suit the areas that you are going to – for example if you are planning on travelling to more remote locations then you should ensure that your kit contains some sterile syringes.
    * Padlocks are another wise purchase. Smaller ones can be used to keep your rucksack secure; by threading them through the loops of your zips. Larger ones can come in handy when securing rooms in many shoestring budget hostels.
    * Money-belts should be considered as a means of keeping cash and important possessions safe and hidden away. They are usually worn around the waist, under clothes. It can be awkward withdrawing money from them so it may also be a good idea to keep a small amount of cash in a more accessible location, such as a small purse in a pocket.
    * Personal alarms should be considered by everyone, not simply lone females. When activated they simply draw attention by making an incredibly loud, piercing noise, which is bound to deter any would-be criminal.
    * It is always a good idea to have a torch handy; apart from the fact that you are likely to find yourself in poorly lit areas far more regularly, the electricity supply will probably be a lot less reliable in the locations you will be visiting. For our conservation projects a head-torch is a particularly good investment.
    * You will probably already have a mobile phone but it is a good idea to purchase a local SIM card when you get out to your destination country, as this reduces costs, both for yourself and for other volunteers calling you. For this reason we ask that all volunteers check with their mobile service provider that their phone has a roaming service available. Local staff will then be able to help you buy a SIM card during your induction.
    * Malaria is one of the biggest killers in a number of our destinations and protecting yourself from being bitten by mosquitoes is vitally important. While your doctor can advise you on the type of medication that you might want to be taking (prophylactic pills are available which can be taken on a daily basis), you should also consider a good quality spray. In addition to this, a mosquito net should be considered; even though most hostels in malaria zones will have their own nets, they are often old and of poor quality.
    * Whilst it is generally advisable to drink only bottled water, or at the very least water that you completely trust as having been thoroughly purified, you may find yourself in a situation where you do not have access to either, in which case it is a good idea to have water purification tablet with you. These may often be sold as part of your medical kit.
    * Protection from the sun is very important, as a number of our destinations can be very hot at certain times of the year, if not all times! A high protection factor sun-cream is the very least you should be arming yourself with; you should also consider taking some sort of hat to protect yourself from the effects of sun-stroke, which comes on quickly and can be very dangerous. After-Sun lotion or moisturiser will help sooth any burnt skin.

Gap-Year Safety: In Destination

The vast majority of crime suffered by foreign travellers is non-violent crime, such as pickpocketing. Potential criminals are unlikely to want to have face-to-face confrontations and for this reason they will tend to go for easy targets. Unfortunately, in most destinations you are going to stick out like a sore thumb, because you are a) young, and b) clearly not a local. For this reason it is important to take certain simple precautions.

    * Look like you know what you are doing. Okay so this isn’t the easiest thing to do in an environment which is completely alien to you, where you want to soak in as much as you possibly can, but one of the clearest giveaways is when people walk around whilst continually scrutinising a large fold-out map! Try to avoid this by working out a route before hand, drawing out or finding a smaller map, or simply checking your larger map in quieter, more discrete moments.
    * Do not show any signs of wealth. Expensive watches/jewellery/sunglasses; unsecured wallets or purses; MP3 players; large obtrusive cameras – these all draw attention to you and mark you out as a potential target for thieves. For this reason it is advisable to not bring very expensive items with you on your trip abroad, let alone have them on your person on a daily basis. You should ensure that any money and photographic equipment you carry with you is as discrete as possible.
    * Be careful of crowded areas. Pickpockets tend to strike in busy areas, where they can get what they want without being seen, even if their victims become aware of what is happening. For this reason a good precaution is to move your day-bag round to the front of you if you happen to find yourself in a crowded place, and make sure you keep an eye - or a hand – on possible places where people might try to gain access to your valuables. Also do not have your valuables readily accessible if you can possibly avoid it; at the bottom of your bag, underneath clothes and books is ideal. And obviously do not leave your bag unattended at any times.
    * Avoid being alone on the street at night-time. Places change when the sun goes down, and even your most well-trodden street can become unfamiliar and potentially dangerous. It is advisable to use public transport or private taxis (but only those recommended by local staff) and to make sure you are part of a group as much as possible. If you have to walk alone, stick to well-lit areas as much as possible and carry a personal alarm with you.
    * Look out for other volunteers and ask them to look out for you. We try to encourage our volunteers to work as a team as much as possible, ranging from keeping an eye on each other’s bags when using public transport during the week, to making sure that everybody is accounted for if you go travelling at the weekend. We particularly request that lone female volunteers are seen safely to their door by other volunteers, and are never the last person to be dropped off from a taxi ride home at the end of a night out.
    * Be wary of people’s motives. It is a great shame, but it is a fact of life that you simply cannot blindly trust strangers. You are likely to approached by a great many people while travelling abroad. Some of these people will be merely curious about you, your language and your culture. Some of them will want to try to sell you something. Others will be begging for money. And others still will have more sinister intentions, often involving extortion of money by some means or another. There are all manner of scams which people run, from short-changing tourists in shops (always be sure to check your change), and unwinnable games played by people out on the streets (often played with playing cards or balls in cups) to scams involving “precious” jewels and fake art exhibitions. In short – don’t act like a fool or you risk being fooled!

      (In the case of begging, it is not our place to moralise on the rights or wrongs of giving money to people who ask for it, but it is worth noting that not all beggars are as destitute as they appear to be, and giving money is only going to make you a greater target for beggars in the future, either from the person who you gave to, or others who witnessed the act. More important, perhaps, is the notion that you should not feel obliged to give money simply because somebody less well-off than yourself asks you to, and – if you really feel like you want to help them – giving them an item of food is probably a better way of helping in any case)

    * Always make sure somebody knows where you are. This is important on many levels; your parents back home will want to know where you are in a general sense – say the city you are in, or the area you are travelling to at the weekend – so be sure to let them know via email, telephone call or text. More locally you should let Projects Abroad staff know if you are planning on going away on a trip out of town and it is important to ensure your fellow volunteers are aware of your plans too. For this reason we strongly recommend buying a local SIM card or phone after you arrive.

This is by no means an exhaustive list, but hopefully it is enough just to get you thinking. Essentially the best advice we can give you is to use your own common sense and then everything should be fine. And remember that - despite the stories you may hear – the vast majority of gap-year travellers get through their time away without any trouble whatsoever. If you have any more questions or concerns however, then please contact one of our advisors on +44 (0)1903 708300.

Graduates facing a tough employment market choose the gap year route instead
It's the hectic time of year where students across the UK are preparing for their final exams, rushing through those last pieces of coursework and looking forward to a well-earned break from study. While the next step for most of those approaching the end of their degree would be to enter the world of work, an increasing number of graduates are choosing an altogether different path.
A recent study conducted by Studentgems.com, a leading employer and graduate matchmaking website, has found that 12% of graduates intend to take a gap year rather than take their chances in a difficult employment market. Though the economic downturn is on its way back up, there is still a long way to go, and with only 5% of job applications resulting in interviews, the freedom and adventure of gap year travel has a considerable appeal.

While taking a gap year is a great way to avoid the employment blues and take some time out, it can also offer the chance to gain useful life experience and develop new skills. In a tough employment market many graduates are looking for travel options that will not only offer a refreshing change from study, but also enhance their employment prospects.

Gap year companies such as Real Gap provide travellers with a range of exciting opportunities across over 35 different destinations around the globe. Explorers can combine adventure with worthwhile and career-boosting experiences such as volunteering, teaching abroad, and a number of certificated courses. Graduates also have the option to mix volunteering with cultural immersion on a variety of tours such as the Thailand Experience and the Kruger to Coast Volunteer Adventure.

For graduates who make up the 34% of those looking for work abroad, Real Gap also offer several paid work programmes, giving travellers the chance to test drive a new career or even start a new life abroad. Travellers with a longer haul journey in mind spend a year away with The Real Ultimate Aussie Package or the New Zealand Paid Work programme, or opt for the China Paid Teaching with TEFL option; a fantastic way to get a TEFL qualification and put newly learnt skills to the test with both 6 month and 12 month placements.

Speaking about the current situation for graduates, Marketing Manager Lauren Mackay was keen to emphasise the benefits of taking a gap year `gap year travel not only offers the opportunity to take a break from years of study, it's also a great way to get some life experience and to gain skills that can help graduates to stand out from the crowd when it comes to searching for a job.'

Students and graduates considering gap year travel can find out more about Real Gap's range of travel options at http://www.realgap.co.uk or call 01892 516164 to speak to one of the company's expert advisers.

Grown up Gap Years - you haven't missed the boat!
Bored of work and being in the same place? Feel like experiencing new and exciting cultures? Need a fresh challenge and grown up gap year options? If you answered yes to these questions then you’re probably considering a career break - and why not? It’s your opportunity to give something back, have fun and get the time out you deserve. Career breakers return from their travelling adventures feeling revived, with new skills and directions and ambitions fulfilled.
Because there is no “normal” length of time for a career break, BUNAC offers volunteer projects all over the world that start from as little as five weeks to as long as eight months. Our volunteering and teaching placements in Africa, South and Central America and Asia provide career breakers of all ages with life changing opportunities and the chance to make a real difference. Ongoing placements range from teaching children to raising HIV/AIDS awareness, from community development to environmental and conservation work. You can use this time to really step outside your comfort zone and learn new skills or use the valuable life experience you have already gained to make a change in the lives of those less fortunate.

Or if you feel like working in a completely new environment, BUNAC’s exclusive IEP visa enables under 35s to live, work and travel in New Zealand on a grown up gap year for an entire year. Whether you decide to continue on your career path or embark on an entirely new ski/surf/sheep farming quest in the adventure capital of the world is entirely up to you! While you may worry about potentially losing a place on the career ladder, it is worth noting that working abroad actually increases one’s employability as it shows adaptability, independence and cultural awareness. The skills and experience that you learn on a working holiday will be a real asset on your return and make a great talking point at interviews!

Aged 33 and having returned from an adventure-filled year with her travel buddy Sue in New Zealand, Jo spoke to us about her working holiday...

Su and I both needed the IEP Work Exchange Visa for our working holiday as we were over 30, but did our age mean our experiences were vastly different from the ‘typical’ Work New Zealander (if there is such a thing)? Yes probably, but I don’t think that is a negative thing.

We often found that our age opened up other avenues to us – I’m sure it played a part in us being invited into strangers' houses to stay and the holiday park deciding to give us a weekly rate.

People obviously undertake this type of adventure for many different reasons, whatever their age, and the main thing is that they have the adventure that they want and return home fulfilled.

The main piece of advice I would give to everybody is meet and interact with the locals and many more experiences will open up to you. And when you do meet other people, don’t just talk about your adventures, LISTEN!

Like the sound of this? You haven’t missed the boat (or flight)!

How to Avoid Scams when Applying to Volunteer Abroad

	Researching a volunteer programs around the world? Not looking to spend a fortune or get scammed by a un-reputable organisation? In recent years literally hundreds of new volunteer organisations have sprung up, most are legitimate but don&#39;t get caught out by some scams.


	There are lots of scams and things to watch out for when you are beginning the process of applying to volunteer to give service, this goes with both large international sending agencies and also grass roots non-profits / charities.

	Some international travel companies have been accused of ripping off applications and charging them fee&#39;s which are really high when if you apply direct to the local project there is only a small donation really needed. Whilst a lot of local organisations claim to have non-profit or charitable status and have positive testimonials on their websites which makes them look very appealing but in reality they are just out to con potential applications into paying for something.

	We just want to prepare you and help you not to get caught out. We have heard feedback from people who have booked, paid and turned up in country for their placement either no to exist or to be not as described. Some organisations offer special prices and cheap upfront fees but towards the end of the booking and also don&#39;t be fooled by some organisations have non-profit status, sometimes the owners will pocket the money at the expense of local staff.

	Recently in the media there has been quite a lot of press and coverage about how effective international volunteers are, and is participating doing more harm than good. You might want to read some of these articles before applying which generally have been focusing on orphanage volunteer programs in countries like Cambodia which has been booming, Westerns / foreigners pay a fee to help children when in reality the children shouldn&#39;t be there in the first place. Orphanage tourism is currently big business and it is alleged that some organisations have been taking children against their families will, or even paying their families to have the children put in a care home just so they can get money through donations and international volunteers.

	There are lots of ways to avoid being scammed though and this generally involves using common sense and research. On the internet there is a vast amount of information, from reviews to social media pages where you can read feedback and actually talk to previous volunteers. Please research all organisations before applying, there are lots of really rewarding opportunities but also some scams to watch out for. To avoid scams check to see if the organisations has a valid website/feedback or if they are listed on reputable resources like Idealist and One World 365.

	People are your best form of guidance, check feedback on websites like Facebook, Twitter, Linked-In, Trip Advisor and forums. Contact past participants to see how their experience went and if they would recommend the organisation.

	Please note most organisations will require you to pay a deposit to book a place but if an organisation starts asking for more money than initially stated or demanding extras fees this is usually a warning sign. But if something seems a bit suspicious or you have any reservations don&#39;t be afraid to ask questions.

	There are lots of reputable agencies offering reasonable prices and even lots of really worthwhile special local operations around the world, just check everything before signing up. If you have any questions about certain organisations feel free to contact us for independent advice.

How to Not Harm Animals When You Travel

	Charles Darwin once said, “The love of all living creatures is the most noble attribute of man”. Witnessing animals in their natural habitats is, perhaps, one of the most fulfilling experiences a person can have whilst abroad. 


	Southeast Asia boasts some of the most exotic and diverse wildlife on the planet. From pygmy elephants to orangutans, there are many exciting species to see which we would never have the opportunity to see at home. However, has our love of exotic animals contributed to the destruction of the sub-continent&#39;s most majestic species?

	With the rise of western mobility has come a significant rise in the profitability of animal tourism, where in today’s world one can play with a tiger for less than the cost of a Starbucks coffee. Darwin was right: we do love animals, and many of us resent the idea of any animal being harmed for human enjoyment. Yet, when we travel, we may unknowingly contribute to the suffering of animals on a monumental scale. Continuingly, with the rise of animal tourism, comes a rise in unnecessary accidents and human fatalities  such as the sad case of a British national in Thailand last year, emphasising the volatile nature of the wild. 

	Ultimately, this article will highlight how we as tourists may be contributing to unethical practises and look at tips on how to avoid this.

	 

	1. Think Before You Book 

	

	You have probably seen images on social media of people riding on the back of elephants, or perhaps cuddling a tiger cub. However, it is important to think before you book. Is what is offered at this particular attraction natural? If you are paying to ride on or pet a usually wild and dangerous animal, watch it walk a tight-rope, or perhaps dunk a basketball, then these animals have likely undergone a process of domestication. You may have seen videos circulated of what is known as &#39;elephant crushing’.

	This kind of process teaches unnatural behaviour to elephants by confining them to tight spaces, or beating them until they willingly submit to its handler’s will. Unfortunately, this process is not unique to elephants. Many other mammals are known to undergo similar treatments such as drugging or the removing of teeth. While these animals have been through a process of domestication, they are still wild and arbitrary mammals which have the potential to act unpredictably and viciously by their very nature.

	With this in mind, consider whether what you are booking is a natural and authentic experience, or whether the animal may have undergone some kind of unpleasant or violent coercion. You should also consider whether you as a young traveller are prepared; before booking any wildlife attraction you must make sure you have adequate travel insurance and the correct vaccinations!

	 

	2. Think Before You Eat

	Another way we contribute to the suffering of animals while travelling Southeast Asia is by what we eat. Tourists are eager to try out local delicacies, ready to participate in what they believe to be a part of local culture; however, you may be unaware that what is being offered could be a rare or endangered species. Furthermore, according to the Soi Dog Foundation, tourists who participate in the eating of dogs are ignorant of the fact that they are often clubbed to death or boiled alive before reaching their plates. So, be sure to think before you eat: are you aware what you are eating or how it has been reared?

	This is an excellent opportunity to try some of the delicious local vegetarian or vegan options Southeast Asia has to offer. While the sound of not eating meat on holiday is an unattractive prospect for most people, vegetables are often the staple food for the local population in Southeast Asian countries, making it a perfect way to immerse yourself in the local culture. It is also important to mention that this is a great way to avoid any stomach bugs while you’re away as it diminishes the chances of becoming ill through eating poorly sourced or cooked meat! Do make sure that you have had a look at the health-specific pages on the FCO’s website for the country you are travelling to, so that you know what to do if you do fall ill.

	 

	3. The Blame Game

	Pointing the finger of blame at certain groups or individuals is counterproductive to achieving sustainable tourism. Instead of blaming ourselves or the people whose travel pictures we see on social media, we must learn from our own mistakes. I, myself, having ridden an elephant while in Laos, who – after being coerced by mahouts to begrudgingly allow me and one other to ride him during peak heat season – angrily stampeded along a shallow river with me on his back.

	As humans, it is not safe to ride or play with naturally unpredictable animals. My unsafe experience led me to question my assumptions about animal tourism, wishing that I had researched more about this issue beforehand. Contrastingly, it is of no use to blame locals for this exploitation. We, as tourists, have created a demand for these kinds of experiences, and, in emerging or rural economies, the tourist industry has become a main source of revenue for entire communities, who depend on this for financial stability. The only path forward is through education regarding responsible animal tourism.

	 

	4. Responsible Animal Tourism

	

	Thanks to the work of animal welfare foundations, ethical tourism is becoming increasingly easier to take part in. Foundations such as World Animal Protection and Wildlife Friends Foundation support ethical wildlife attractions in Southeast Asia. For example, Boon Lott&#39;s Elephant Sanctuary, the Kindred Spirit Elephant Sanctuary and Elephant Nature Park in Thailand do not condition their animals to perform, and are places where visitors can participate in an authentic and safe wildlife experience abroad. Please visit their websites for more information on ethical animal attractions in Southeast Asia and how you can personally help combat the destruction of Southeast Asia’s wildlife.  

	 

	By being prepared before your travel, you will be in the best position to experience all the finer things that Southeast Asia has to offer. For the latest foreign travel information, head to the FCO&#39;s Travel Advice website. You can also follow the FCO on Twitter, watch their videos on YouTube and add them on Facebook to get instant access on all of the latest travel updates.

How Working at Summer Camp Will Change Your Life

	So, you&#39;re thinking of working on a Summer Camp? Go for it, I won&#39;t stop you! But, before you start throwing deposits and references all over the place, take the time to read from the experience of a soon-to-be 5th Year International Councelor; You&#39;re about to make a terrible decision (hear me out...)


	Why? I mean, how bad could it be? You&#39;ll get paid to spend two months living for free and having fun on a camp, two months building unbreakable friendships and of course; 2 months of building that perfect tan! What&#39;s not to like? Well, nothing, which is exactly the problem. 

	 

	Meet The Real You

	If you choose to go to camp, you will absolutely have the time of your life, but you&#39;ll come back changed; Your career will have become a job, your home will have become a house and your all important five year a plan will probably have been thrown under a bus. Your world will suddenly feel small and slow, you&#39;ll feel lost for a short time, as if your entire being has just become confused with its direction, but all this is ok... in fact, its better than ok, its amazing; because, through camp, you will have just met the most incredible and important person in the World; you&#39;ve just met &#39;The Real You&#39;.

	This may not make a lot of sense, surly you&#39;ve always been &#39;you&#39;, right? In a way, yes, but you have different versions of yourself depending on the situation right? At home you are &#39;Version I&#39;, at work you are &#39;Version II&#39;, with friends you are &#39;Version III&#39;, get the idea? Well, at camp, you are the original, mint condition, collector&#39;s edition of yourself. You may not even realise that you&#39;ve changed, but once you&#39;re home, others will notice a difference; after a Summer of running activities, looking after kids, planning events and leading projects, you will have gained &#39;the unmeasurables&#39;, a set of qualities that subtly tell anyone you meet that you are totally in command of yourself and everything you set your mind to.

	 

	How I Got Started

	The process may be daunting, but nothing worthwhile is easy. Take my case and you&#39;ll have no excuse; In 2013, I was 20 years old and had never left the UK, never been on a plane and never been on a trip lasting over 2 weeks. After searching the web for a way to travel, I stumbled on Summer Camps; something grabbed my attention and I followed the process, I completed the application, I found the flights and did everything right up to the point where I had to commit money. That’s where I faltered. It took me about a month to decide to pay the deposit, then it was real, I was going abroad! I never truly thought it would happen, doubting every step of the way;

	I&#39;ll never get accepted, surly;
	I did.

	I&#39;ll never get placed, no way!
	I did.

	I&#39;ll never get a contract, not a chance;
	I did.

	Time and time again I was proven wrong, after the interviews, applications, forms and payments, I was suddenly in the airport with a giant bag and a pile of papers that felt far too important to be in my possession. I had nerves that would have made Cowardly Lion blush, I had absolutely no idea what I was doing, but, I was doing it, and it felt incredible.

	 

	Arrival at Camp

	

	Once arriving on the other side, everything was a blur, from terminal to cabin, thrust into a small space in the middle of nowhere with a bunch of total strangers, but everyone hit it off immediately, there was so much common ground from the outset simply as we had all been through exactly the same process to make it this far. We spent the first night getting unpacked into the cabins while introducing ourselves and getting to know each other. Then there were the returners, I&#39;d never encountered such a strange collection of people, in fact they were beyond strange, running around, singing songs, laughing at antics and events from previous Summers and generally acting as if they were drunk, in a way they were, drunk on camp (Little did I know that I would be acting much the same following Summer).

	 

	Role as a Camp Counselor

	

	Fast forward again, half way through the Summer, things are going great, at first I was overwhelmed by the tsunami of children charging up the hill to the cabins, I had to learn half a hundred names, run activities, organise events and govern a cabin full of 10 year olds, it was all I could do to keep my head screwed on the right way, all around seemed like total chaos. I can&#39;t tell you of the moment I figured it all out, I just did, it just clicked. One moment I was in orientation half panicking about how awful I was going to be, the next, I was a councelor in week three of camp.

	Half the battle in this place in your head, conquer the anxiety and the worry, and you&#39;ll have it.

	You&#39;ll start getting &#39;your firsts&#39; in week two, the first time you&#39;re asked to tie a shoe lace, the first time they make a drawing for you, the first time they trust you with their favourite toy or their lucky hat. To you, it may be nothing, but to them, its everything, it shows that they are comfortable with you, that they trust you, that they look up to you and want to be more like you. This is when the change happens, you realise that you&#39;re no longer here for the cheap living and easy travelling, you&#39;re here for them. Even though they may wake you up at the crack of dawn and keep you up till midnight, they may throw food or get into fights on the sports field. Whatever they do, however they feel, you&#39;ll be there to guide, help or show them through it.

	 

	What You Will Learn

	

	By the time Summer comes to an all too sudden end, you&#39;ll have made a vast network of new friends and contacts, most of which you feel more comfortable around than many people from your original social circles, whenever you see these people again (and you will), you will immediately convert into one of those strange &#39;post-camp&#39; people that seem to exist purely to laugh and talk about camp.

	But also, you&#39;ll have taught someone to swim and someone else to be a good sportsman, you&#39;ll have shown a camper how to write a letter to their parents and taught them how to clean up after themselves, how to treat each other fairly. In a world away from their parents and families, you&#39;ll have given them the foundation of becoming truly independent. It goes without saying that their parents are irreplaceable of course, but in just a few short weeks you&#39;ll be humbled by just how close you came.

	 

	Positive Effects

	You&#39;ll come away from camp having changed lives, truly. But you&#39;ll also note how those same, sometimes annoying and often hilarious campers have also changed you.

	At the start of this article I stated that camp would turn your world upside down, change your priorities and generally be a bad idea for your long term plans; well, take it from me as I start the process for Year Five, you will never, ever, regret a bad decision less than the one you&#39;re about to make.

	Now take a deep breath, dive in and get ready to meet The Real You.

How WWOOFing Changed My Life

	WWOOF, or World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms, is a worldwide organization that hooks farmers up with travelers. Travelers work on the farm for four to six hours a day in exchange for room and board. 


	WWOOF offers travelers a great way to travel on a budget, get to know the locals, and spend time in rural areas, while hosts get a little help and the chance to share their knowledge and perhaps plant the seeds of a lifelong passion - which is exactly what happened in my case.  

	 

	My introduction to WWOOFing started at a biology research camp in the Rockies. Here I worked with a German woman who had recently finished up a WWOOF stay.  She didn’t seem to have the best things to say, but perhaps it was because she was a vegetarian on a beef ranch.  Regardless, the idea intrigued me. I was about to graduate from university, and despite a lack of cash, was itching to go abroad. 

	 

	My first WWOOF experiences were in Australia, and while they were among the highlights of my trip, I can’t exactly call them life-changing. They did, however, eventually lead me to WWOOFing in Nepal, which is where the real magic happened.  

	I Saw what Sustainable Living Actually Looks Like 

	My first month was spent on a farming co-op in the Terai region of Nepal.  While I was quick to realize that my labor wasn&#39;t particularly needed, I was amazed by what I saw. 

	At the helm of the co-op was Chandra Adhikari. He was working diligently to incorporate permaculture principles and other creative techniques with traditional farming methods.  He had set up lights to attract flies to the pond at night to feed his fish - fish that would be released into the rice paddies in summer to fertilize and eat unwanted critters. He dabbled in farming frogs, worked at making more fuel-efficient stoves, and had built a methane digester to turn human and buffalo waste into cooking fuel. All the waste was then sent to the worms, who had to be kept on an island with a moat and a wall to keep the mongooses from eating them all.  

	Then it was onto farm number two. Surya, or Buwa (father), was equally passionate about his permaculture practice. This time, the farm was on the terraced foothills of the Himalayas.  Buwa grew coffee as a cash crop but also incorporated something like 80 useable plants into his coffee grove. Neem, cinnamon, papayas, and pineapple were just a few of the plants growing there. Other villages brought him their own coffee and Buwa dried and husked them before sending them off to be roasted. 

	 

	I Realized there was Problem

	On my first farm, Chandra and I took a visit to a nearby agricultural university, where a professor talked about the potential of agrotourism, and how it would be Nepal’s best chance against big agri-business. He shared some of the ways Nepalis had been fusing modern and traditional methods to make some ingenious innovations. Improved efficiency and the potential income from agri-business would be enough to unite Nepal against some of the devastating effects or corporate farming in India.  

	 

	On Surya’s farm, I learned a little more. A small English library introduced me to Vandana Shiva’s Stolen Harvest, and I was stunned by the devastating environmental effects of commercial shrimp farming in mangrove swamps, and mass suicides as farmers fell deeper and deeper into debt after switching to GMO crops. Say what you will about GMOs, but it was clear that the economies of the developing countries Shivw wrote about were not ready for them.  

	I Found the Key to Happiness (or at Least One of Them)

	Food!  After a while, I was starting to feel keenly aware of what I was eating. Very little food came from off either of the farms. Perhaps only the tea and sugar (though most sugar needs were provided by the bees). I was eating completely local food, hand processed, painstakingly cooked on clay stoves, and eaten with the hands.  Nowhere was there a break in the connection between the land and the food I put in my mouth.  It felt amazing!  I stopped craving sweets and junk food, and I started feeling the strangest urges to head into the coffee grove to meditate.  

	 

	 

	I grew up wandering around in the woods and had started a career in Fish & Wildlife. I was no stranger to the idea that being connected to nature was important to my happiness, but this took it to a whole new level.

	I Chose my Battleground and Started Planning

	Most travel addicts return from a trip and start dreaming about their next trip, but I couldn’t wait to get home to Canada and get started. While I was feeling deeply connected to the land in Nepal, there was something missing - it wasn’t my home.  

	 

	Back in Canada, I got to work. I joined WWOOF Canada, and on my days off of field work in Northern BC, headed south to the tiny town of Hazelton to work with a couple who were already living the off-the-grid dream. From them, I learned about compost powered hot water systems, passive solar heating, recycled veggie oil generators, and a whole slew of projects they had done or were planning on doing. They had spent years gleaning whatever knowledge they could from whoever they could and had made a great success of their projects and their lives.  

	I Found My Inner Educator

	Then there was a small issue of finding land and getting the time for my own projects.  I was working seasonally at the time as a backcountry park ranger in a remote location and as the fisheries technician. While my work allowed me to save money quickly, it also occupied the entire growing season. 

	 

	The issue was that while I loved the work, I never found it particularly fulfilling. It was a job I did for me, not for the rest of the world. Teaching came up not because of summers off, but because I wanted to share my new-found passion. I had worked a bit in outdoor education before, so I knew I liked at least some aspects of it.  In fact, I loved seeing the effects getting connected to nature had on kids. Unfortunately, I also knew that I found the classroom environment stifling.  Regardless I started working on my Bachelor of Education, deciding that I would work my way into teaching an outdoor program.  

	 

	Eight years later, I’m still working on buying the property, and I’ve sifted from outdoor education to special education. Despite outward appearance, the effect WWOOF had on my life shows up in my life every day. It forced me to change my perspective on how I was living my life and made me want to make a difference. It changed my career, influenced where I chose to settle down and continues to affect how I eat and behave as a consumer.  I may not have my bit of land yet, but I’m still growing a bit of food.

Information for Students, School, College Leavers

	If you are have completed studies or are finishing school/college soon, and you are not sure what to do next why not consider a gap year. We help lots of students and graduates take breaks abroad every year especially during end of year exams.


	Every year when exam results are released, this is a very stressful time and we get lots of e-mails from people wondering what to do next. If you got the results you wanted great, this is still a chance to take time out and deferring your entry till next year which will give you time to think if going to university is right for you. If you didn&#39;t get the results you were expecting don&#39;t despair! You can either go through clearing or consider take a gap year. In the UK with the increase in tuiton fees which are astromonically high have put many people off, but before jumping straight into full time employment considering planning a trip overseas with our website.

	 

	If you are young, healthy and are able to raise money to fund travels we highly recommend taking time out for a gap year. Ask most people what they regret when older and most will say not doing more when younger so if a gap year is an option, try not to let this happen to you. When/if you take a gap year if your choice, we highly recommend but there are lots of options available for all interests.

	 

	Also did you know you can now earn UCAS points during a gap year. In what can only be an acknowledgement of the importance of alternative forms of education and experience, the universities and colleges application service has linked with ASDAN (Award Scheme Development and Accreditation Network) to allow students opting for a gap year to use their experience to help get into university. In order to gain up to 70 points under the personal effectiveness category, you must have your volunteer project registered with ASDAN and then build a portfolio of your activities as proof of the skills you have acquired whilst on the project. Once these have been verified, you will qualify for a Certificate of Personal Effectiveness (CoPE) level 3, with which you can claim your UCAS points!

	 

	Anna Davis, Education correspondent for the London Evening Standard, wrote that the CoPE is equivalent to getting an A at the AS level. The key is making sure the higher education institution (HEI) and course you’ve chosen will accept ASDAN certificate towards entry points. Currently there are 34 higher education institutions that will accept CoPE points. I expect the number of HEIs that will accept CoPE to rise in the few years given the rise in university fees and the push for students to couple formal education with practical skills and experience. The CoPE-UCAS agreement is also welcome news for those planning to work and live abroad. This reinforces the need for early and thorough gap year planning. However, it is important to remember that not all HEIs accept CoPE and that for most courses a good grade in the specific AS will be the best way to achieve the required UCAS points. But Professor Alison Wolf, who led a government inquiry into education qualifications, said: “There is a danger that people will believe that universities will treat all points as equal and a terrible danger that the most vulnerable people will be misled and make choices they shouldn’t make.”

	 

	The gap year will give you the opportunity to explore the world, make a difference in another community, learn about yourself and gain useful work experience and skills that will transfer to either higher education or work…or both! If your preferred HEI isn’t currently accepting CoPE, don’t let that prevent you from missing out on a wonderful gap year experience. So, go on that gap year, make a difference and maybe earn some UCAS points!

	 

	So what are you waiting for? Take a gap year, make a difference and earn UCAS points at the same time! Contact us for specific advice info@gapyear365.com.

	Interview with a Projects Abroad Law Intern in China 

	Law is a notoriously competitive industry to break into. A Projects Abroad Law placement offers the chance to gain some work experience in the field. Zaineb Siddiqi graduated from The University of Law in Moorgate and she recently participated on one of our Law placements in Shanghai. She explains in an interview with Richard Egan, the Communications Officer in China, what she has been up to and what her experience has been like so far!

	Why did you decide to become a law intern in China?

	I have done some previous work experience placements at law firms in the UK, but I wanted some international legal training. Most law firms in London are looking for people who have knowledge of law from different countries so a part of the reason for the trip was to prove to my future employers that I have a keen interest in international law and that I am willing to go overseas to prove that. I wanted to specifically obtain first-hand knowledge of Chinese law, because lots of firms in London have Chinese clients. It will really help me in the future if I have an understanding of Chinese law and culture.  Also, I specifically wanted to go to Shanghai because many law firms in London have partners in Shanghai.  Another reason is that an occupation as a solicitor is such a competitive market so I need all the experience I can get.  I had a long look on the internet and saw the law internships that Projects Abroad offered and now here I am! 

	You’re working at the Tuo Ying Law Offices? Which area of law do they focus on?

	The main focus is on intellectual property law in China. The company have some international clients, the biggest being Samsung, but as of yet the firm is just based in Shanghai and they have no international partners. However, Tuo Ying Law Offices are currently in the process of attempting to expand and go international. During my time at the firm the company have had meetings with representatives from firms in Malaysia and the UK about potentially agreeing on a partnership in the near future. It is great opportunity as the meetings are in English so I can attend.

	During your project did you feel as though you are an asset to the team?

	Yes, I definitely think so! The partners here are always asking me questions about law procedures in the UK and are interested in my response. For example they have asked me to prepare an hour presentation about the ‘Protection of Intellectual Property in UK and the EU’ which the whole office will attend. It feels really good to help out like this and I feel as though my time here can be a learning experience for them as well as me.

	Other than attending meetings and preparing for a presentation, what other tasks do you carry out while working at the firm?

	My main duty at the firm is to shadow the lawyers. I usually shadow the main partner and he always translates everything that he is doing and he seems very eager for me to learn as much about Chinese law as possible. I also proof read English documents and write response emails. The majority of my day is spent researching Chinese law and asking my colleagues any questions I may have. As I said, the lawyers are never hesitant about asking me questions either!

	From your previous experience working at firms in the UK, is there a difference between the office atmosphere in Shanghai compared with the UK? 

	Yes, I think in the UK it is strictly ‘business’ and everyone is only focused on getting the job done, where as in China there is a really friendly atmosphere and everyone is very hospitable and accommodating. Every day at lunch the whole office goes to eat together and which makes the atmosphere relaxed and enjoyable. 

	From your experience it seems as though you have a really good relationship with your colleagues?

	Before coming I expected my interaction with the senior partners to be very limited, but we interact with each other the whole day! I am very pleased about this. 

	How useful do you think this experience is for your future?

	I know that this experience will be great for my future because I have proved that I have used my initiative and probably most importantly that I can adapt to different surroundings. Working with international law is something that I really want to do in the future so I think that this has been a great step towards reaching this goal! Also, of course having work experience in China will look great on my C.V!

	Outside of work how are you finding life in China?

	I’m really enjoying it! I live in an apartment in a very central area of Shanghai with other Projects Abroad volunteers. Although we are from different backgrounds and countries we all get on really well and most nights we head out for dinner together. We also arrange weekend trips so, although I came to China alone, I quickly made lots of friends. 

	Finally, what advice would you give to someone who is considering to intern at a law company in China?

	Go for it! This is an experience I will never forget and I have learnt so much! One thing I would suggest though is to try and learn a bit of Mandarin before coming as it helps when communicating with the staff and local people.

London: the perfect city to learn languages
Learning languages is good for your soul. Everyone who learns languages feels they are doing something fulfilling, something that will help them develop as human beings, individually and as a group. It may have to do with the feeling that there’s more beyond our limits. In fact, when you learn a language you also learn about a different culture, with different people, values, ideas, etc. While taking Chinese courses London students explain that there’s something bringing you together with the ‘different’, something that makes you feel identified with them. That might be the reason why language students tend to be more tolerant and understanding.
There are places that are considered to be “better” for language learning, and London is one of them. The population of London is made up of a wide range of different ethnicities, religions and cultures. Three hundred different languages are spoken in London, and it is visited every year by millions of people from around the world. London is a world-class international city, offering different things to the traveler, events and attractions that will inspire the imagination. 

According to the Office for National Statistics, 45% of Britain’s non-white population lived in London in 2001. London’s seven million residents follow 14 faiths and speak three hundred languages. In fact, to celebrate London’s diversity, events like the anti-racist music festival Respect are organized in the city.

With numbers like there, we can only think see London as a perfect city for language learning, cultural exchange and diversity promotion. If everyone with whom you interact happens to be interested in the rest of the world, imagine how much you can learn just by being surrounded by them. Whether you are taking Spanish, Chinese, German or Russian lessons London is sure to be the place where your new skill will be boosted. In general, when you start walking the path of language learning, you are not satisfied with only one language. You will want to explore more cultures, as you discover more and more differences and similarities with that of yours. Finding a suitable atmosphere that will trigger these exploring desires is crucial towards self-development.

Marathon du Medoc - A Challenge Not to Be Missed

	The Marathon du Medoc takes place in the Medoc wine region near Bordeaux. This lovely area of France in the south-west holds one of the top marathons in the world. This marathon is often on the bucket list of runners and for Janice Chung, it was an opportunity to combine her love of France with a passion for running. Here she shares her experience of what you can expect if you would like to compete in the future…


	Oysters. Beef. Cheese. Ice cream. Granola Bars. Cookies. Chips. Wine. Lots of wine. I ran the Marathon du Medoc in 2013 and this nourishment would get me through the 42.2 kilometers. It would not be one of my fastest races, but I didn’t really care. All I cared about was finishing…..sober.

	I arrived in Bordeaux two nights before the big race. This gave me a chance to barely get used to the time change. After all, the race was scheduled for 9 am, which was 3 am Toronto time. The day before the race, I hopped on a bus for a two hour ride to Pauillac to pick up my race kit. When I arrived, it was as if the party had already started. There were booths selling pate, wine, breads, sausages and other delicious foods. But the best was the deal of a glass of white wine and 6 oysters for 7 Euros, which is the equivalent of about $10 Canadian. Why not indulge the day before the race? I’d be burning over 2500 calories, so what did I care!

	I had to get up early to catch the 2 hour bus ride back to Pauillac and when I arrived, I thought I had entered a carnival with the Cirque du Soleil headlining. Suspended by an incredibly large inflatable balloon was a trapeze artist who was doing flips in the air. The balloon was transparent and tethered to the ground. Techno music was blaring out of many speakers and there was definitely a party mood.

	The day was overcast and chilly but this didn’t matter for the 8000 runners, many who were dressed up in costumes. Every year there is a theme and this particular year celebrated “Science Fiction”.  Thousands of runners were dressed up, some with tutus and some in superhero costumes.  There was even a gentleman in flippers with a snorkel and an inflatable dingy around his waist. I do not know how he could run a marathon in flippers! Being somewhat more reserved, I did not dress up.

	Once the gun went off, it was not necessarily a race to the finish, but rather a race to the first water station. But this was not a typical water station with cups of water. Instead there were hundreds of cups of wine laid out on the table for the runners to pick up and taste or gulp down. Plates of chips, crackers, raisins, cut oranges, and sugar cubes were also available. It was like a feeding and drinking frenzy. I was able to hit 18 of the 23 stations during the marathon. Some stations were too crowded. There wasn’t really pushing to get a glass of wine. We were just eager to drink and run on our merry way.

	My strategy was to take a few sips of wine at every station, and also accompany the wine with some water and food. I did not want to get drunk or pass out. While my intention was not to get a personal best time, I certainly wanted to finish the race….standing up with a smile on my face.  The lucky soul who finished first, however, got his or her body weight in wine.

	The Marathon du Medoc is not just a race down a road but rather a race that winds through some of the most famous vineyards in the world such as Chateau Mouton-Rothschild and Chateau Lynch-Bages. The grounds are open for runners to pass by the magnificent architecture and estates that have been around since the 1700s. The first marathon was created in 1984 by five Bordeaux runners, four of them doctors, who wanted to celebrate “pleasure, not pain” (as quoted in Forbes magazine).

	The atmosphere throughout the entire race was fun and supportive. A number of times it must have looked like I was slowing down, because there was always a helping hand behind my elbow, encouraging me onwards or the crowd cheering  “Allez! Allez!” (Go! Go!).

	Near the end of the race, I just had to stop for some freshly shucked oysters. After gulping a couple down with some wine, of course, I saw eight runners dressed as “The Flash”---in bright red costumes. I cautiously approached them and asked them if I could have my picture taken with them. Not only did they agree, but they also decided to lift me up in the air!  That certainly gave me a final burst of energy so that I could dash to the finish line, pausing briefly, of course to pick up an ice cream bar. It was the most delicious ice cream I had ever had. I even momentarily thought about turning around and getting another one, however, the end was near.

	Crossing the finish line wasn’t the only thrill for me that day. What a treat it was to be handed a finisher’s medal, a bottle of wine in a special wooden box, a commemorative knapsack and a wine cup on a rope! I needed that cup because there was more wine to come in the wine and beer tent!

Mexico City Travel Guide

	Mexico City is a must, at least, once in a lifetime. It is one of the most populated cities in the world. It is a very beautiful city, chaotic for some, colorful and diverse for others. 


	The people are happy and friendly; the climate is perfect, not too cold, not too hot; it’s a multicultural country, with 63 indigenous languages; its cultural, natural and historical heritage is classified among the sites of UNESCO; and the food is delicious.

	Mexico City is expensive, but you can find really nice places to stay, eat, and travel that are very cheap. View our guide and top tips how to visit Mexico City on a budget.

	 

	How to Get to Mexico City

	

	There are daily flights from numerous international destinations direct to Mexico City.

	Airlines which fly direct to  Mexico City from the United Kingdom include: Juarez International

	
		Aeromexico & British Airways 


	Other airlines flying to Mexico City from international destinations include:

	
		KLM, Air Canada, Air Europa, Air France, Alitalia, American Airlines, Avianca, China Southern, Delta, Iberia, LATAM, Lufthansa, Virgin Atlantic, Hainan Airlines and WestJet.


	For the cheapest flights use Skyscanner to compare and book in advance.

	From other destinations in Mexico there are various ways to get to Mexico city including public bus which is the cheapest method although not the safetst. If you would like to visit multiple destinations you might want to check out Mexico tours.

	 

	Safety

	

	Mexico City does have a reputation but most international tourists have no issues as long as are careful. Be sure to buy travel insurance in advance, we recommend World Nomads.

	 

	Cheap Places to Stay in Mexico City

	There are very nice hotels and hostels all around the city. We suggest staying near the historical center which is a good base to move around the city. The following hostels are very cheap and recommended:
	 

	1. Downtown Beds

	Downtown Beds is a hostel in the heart of the Historical Center and it is the best alternative if you are staying a few days or even a long term. It is from the chain of Grupo Habitat Hotels (one of the best alternative 5 star hotels in Mexico). The price for a bed per night in an eight people bedroom with a shared bathroom goes from 200 MXN (14 US Dollars/12 Euros) to 550 MXN for a private room. It also has a dinning room, pool, terrace, laundry and a bar.

	To compare prices, see reviews and book, visit: Booking.com | Hostel World

	 

	2. Hostel Regina

	Hostel Regina is also in the Historical Center, a bit far away from the Cathedral, but it is still a good place. It has 100 beds, each bed per night is 190 MNX, and there are also private bedrooms. The good thing about this place is that all the prices are breakfast included. It has a kitchen, a TV room, Wifi and Internet, laundry and a bar.

	To compare prices, see reviews and book, visit: Booking.com 

	 

	Getting Around Mexico City

	

	Mexico City is secure in general, but you have to be careful like in any big city in the world. The best way to get anywhere is in the subway or Metrobus (a bus that has many lines). The price for a one-way ticket for either of these services is 6 MXP (33 cents of US Dollars/35 cents of Euro). 

	We strongly suggest not taking taxis from the streets, as they are not very safe. There are some “taxis de sitio” which means they belong to a business site and are safe taxis; they might me more expensive, but you will get to your destination with no problems. Ask in the desk of your hostel/hotel, they will have a couple of phone numbers of these sites and they can call for you.

	 

	Best Things to See & Do in Mexico City 

	If you want to see all the main sights of the city center then I recommend walking to be the best way of getting around because you’ll find some nice and unexpected places along the way. Check out some essential places you must visit in Mexico City below...

	 

	Historical Center

	

	
		Cathedral: It was built in sections from 1573 to 1813.
	
		Templo mayor: It was the center dedicated to make religious ceremonies in the time of the Aztecs. There are guided tours.  It is to the right of the Cathedral.
	
		Palacio Nacional: They give guided tours, so make sure you make a reservation. In 1522 it was the residence of Hernan Cortes. Later on it was the home for several presidents. Nowadays, it houses various government offices. It also has some Murals by the famous Mexican artist Diego Rivera.
	
		Madero Street: It is a street where the cars are not allowed to go through. It is a very crowded and beautiful street with shops, food courts and have some small stores which sell fresh fruit, in case you want a snack.  
	
		Torre Latinoamericana: It was the highest building built between 1933 and 1960 (today it is the sixth highest) and the only skyscraper built in a seismic zone. It has a 360° observation point and a restaurant on the top of the tower. The view is impressive. They say it seems like Mexico City has no end.
	
		Palacio de Bellas Artes: Built by President Porfirio Diaz at the beginning of the twentieth century, the inauguration was in 1934. It is a magnificent building not only outside, but also inside. They give tours and an explanation of the building, and if you’re lucky you can go inside and see the amazing glass curtain on the stage made out of Tiffany glass. You can also buy tickets to see the different regional dances of each state, called Ballet Folklorico de México. It is really worth seeing this majestic monument and the performance (which even the men like).
	
		Post Office Palace (Palacio Postal): Known as “Correos de México”. It was built in early XIX. It was the first building where you could send letters. The building inside is one of my favorites; you can imagine the people in that time and how they sent letters to their families. The building still serves as a postal service office.


	 

	Reforma/Polanco

	

	
		Angel de la Independencia: It is on Reforma Street. Nowadays, it is the symbol of National Independence and the place where any soccer championship is celebrated or any national rallies.
	
		Museo de Antrolopología: It is the best museum in Mexico City. In it you can explore the pre-Hispanic history of the Mayans of Yucatan, the Aztecs of central Mexico, the Zapotecas of Oaxaca etc., seeing their monuments of stone and murals and get an idea of what Mexico city has become over the years. It is a must!
	
		Voladores de Papantla: After visiting the emblematic Museo de Antropologia, ask for the show of the Papantla Flyers, (in the garden outside, by the entrance to the Museum) which is something extraordinary and impressive. Papantla is a town in the State of Veracruz, home of the Totonaco Indians. You will see something unique. It is a religious ceremony to make a tribute to fertility. It is a dance with five men: they climb up a 37 meters (90 feet) pole. At the top, on a very small platform one starts playing a drum and a flute and dances. The other four tie their ankles with a rope and they throw themselves into the sky, extending their arms as if they were birds flying.  They give 13 turns in the air multiplied by 4, signifies 52, which mean the years of one century that lasted in the pre-Hispanic calendar.
	
		Mercado de Artesanías: This is a craft market located in the neighborhood of La Zona Rosa. All the products are 100% Mexican. The prices are good and fair, the sellers might want to make you a discount, but I suggest you buy it for the price, as most of the income they get from the market is their only one, and besides you won’t find anything like that anywhere else on earth!
	
		Castillo de Chapultepec: It is the only castle in Mexico and was the home of Emperor Maximiliano I Hapsburg and his wife Carlota, who ruled during the 1860’s, supported by the invading French army. Nowadays, it is the National Museum of History.
		 


	South

	

	
		Xochimilco: It is a very long canal with “trajineras” (which are a type of big canoas driven by a man) with playful and colorful decorations. They usually have names of women. People go with friends and families to enjoy a nice and quite place in Mexico city.
	
		UNAM: It is the first national public university in Mexico.
	
		Museo de Frida Kahlo: It is the house converted in museum of the famous painter, Frida Kahlo.
	
		Museo Sumaya: It is a modern building in the neighborhood of Polanco. Its collections are European paintings from XV to XVIII centuries.


	 

	Best Places to Eat in Mexico City 

	

	In Mexico City every corner has a stand of quesadillas and other street dishes, which are usually very cheap and delicious.  There are this little stores called Oxxo where you can find the best potatoes chips and other candies, breads and chocolates made in Mexico. The trendy and hipster neighborhoods are Condesa and Roma.

	There you will find many coffee shops, organic restaurants, Mexican and international food, bars, shops here are some places to check out:

	
		Azul Condesa/La Tecla: Mexican fusion food. Condesa neighborhood
	
		Puro Corazón/La Casa de las Sirenas: Mexican food. The first is cheap, the second might be a bit expensive but it is worth it.
	
		Beso huasteco: A very beautiful old house made a Mexican restaurant. It is a very good price and the plates are big enough. Roma neighborhood.
	
		Mi gusto es/Fishers/La Ostra: They are a seafood restaurant and offer very tasty options.


	
	These are some suggestions, but there are plenty good, cheap and nice restaurants in these neighborhoods. It is difficult to stay updated as they open one almost each month.

	Located in Eastern Europe, Moldova is a beautiful destination which gained independence in 1991 as part of the break-up of the Soviet Union. One of the benefits of visiting is you will get an authenic experience where the thousands of tourists haven&#39;t yet arrived. This country is very safe and when visiting you will get to experience the slower pace of life and also get to taste the local food which is suprisingly good. Moldova does suffer from widespread poverty and there is a need for international volunteers to work alongside local staff and help projects. Participants have been volunteering in Moldova for over 20 years and you can too.

Montreal to Campbellton, New Brunswick by Rail

	‘Murder on the Orient Express’, ‘The Lady Vanishes’, ‘Casey Jones’, The Flying Scotsman’, the worlds of literature, cinema, music and folklore are littered with stories based around the railways. Travelling by rail is arguably the best way to travel and it is definitely the best way to travel if you are not in any particular hurry. Certainly it is the most romanticised method of travel. As far as I am aware no epic sagas have ever taken place on a plane, my apologies to Samuel L. Jackson


	The railway has played an important part in the history of Canada. The settlement of the Canadian west was aided immensely by the vested interest of railway companies. Canada is big, walking or driving across it takes a long, long time. This is particularly true if where you’re going has no roads and if cars have not been invented yet. These two factors conspired to make railways both very popular and extremely profitable.

	Historically, the Canadian west has been abundant in resources while the east of the country is full of industries in demand of those resources. Getting those resources across the prairies required a herculean effort. As a condition for its entry into the Canadian Federation in 1871, British Columbia demanded a transport link to the east.

	When they had asked for a connection with the east the government of British Columbia had intended for the creation of a wagon road, but Prime Minister John A. Macdonald instead proposed a railway. Construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway began in 1881 with the first spike being driven in Bonfield, Ontario. A scant six years later in 1887 the first official train arrived in what is now Vancouver.

	The genius of the men who plotted the Canadian Pacific Railway is not to be found in the completion of the project. That victory belongs to the workers who laboured to traverse the Canadian wilderness in six short years. No, the genius of the men who envisioned the railway can be found in their long term thinking. They had built a railway through a massive portion of the world where people who would have had need of a railway did not live and so, they decided to make their railway even more valuable by importing people to live beside it.

	As a part of the contract the Canadian Pacific Railway Company was awarded 100,000 square kilometres of land. The Canadian Pacific Railway Company duly embarked on chartering some boats and offered land and transport to families in Europe to come and settle the Canadian Prairies. By doing this they ensured that a demand would always exist for their shiny new railway. The people that had settled the prairies had to live near to the railway in order to have any link to the world. It is here that the true Machiavellian genius of the minds that devised the Canadian Pacific Railway can be seen.

	Winnipeg, Manitoba saw its population explode from 25,000 people in 1891 to more than 179,000 in 1921, a rise which coincides with the arrival of the Canadian Pacific Railway. Saskatchewan, Manitoba’s neighbour to the west, saw it’s population rise sharply too as a direct result of the arrival of the railway. Given the importance of the train to the history of Canada it seems somewhat fitting that we spent some time on one during our trip across the country.

	It takes seventeen hours to get from Montreal to Moncton by train. Before I went to Canada the longest that I had ever spent on a bus was when I went from Dublin to Killarney, a journey that took six hours.  Before Canada this, to me, was a long journey. After Canada I find six hours to be entirely reasonable and journeys of three hours or less are barely worth talking about.

	Having completed a thirteen hour bus trip from Banff to Jasper the thought of a seventeen hour train journey was not as daunting as it may seem. After all, what’s four hours between friends? It may not have seemed like much at the time but in reality it took longer to get from Montreal to Moncton than it did to get from Dublin to Vancouver and that is including a three hour layover in London.

	My girlfriend is blessed with the ability to turn sleep on and off like a tap. She can sleep when she likes, for as long as she likes, wherever she likes. I, on the other hand, am unable to sleep while in transit for anything more than half an hour. Not only did I spend sixteen and a half hours of the overnight train journey wide awake, I also spent them alone, as my travelling companion was asleep with her head under a blanket.

	Our journey took us out of Montreal and then through north east Quebec. As the journey took place at night, I can tell you very little about Quebec outside of Montreal. What I can tell you is that there is a place called Saint-Louis-du-Ha! Ha! a place that I now very much want to visit based on name alone.

	As the train sped on through the darkness I tried to pass the time. I read, I stared at the back of the seat in front of me, I contemplated ‘accidentally’ waking Anna up and interspersed all of this with futile attempts to sleep. We had left Montreal at 5pm so it was in a ragged, tired and agitated state that I found myself in Campbellton, in the Province of New Brunswick at 7am the following morning.

	As the train idled at the station in Campbellton the dawn was beginning to break over New Brunswick. It was now early December and the deep, darkness of a winter’s night had grown paler and was changing to an orange hue as the sun began to ascend over the Chaleur Bay. As the train pulled out from the station the sun had climbed high enough to illuminate rolling waves and circling gulls. With a tired smile all agitation left me as I realised that I was now looking out at the sparkling waters of the Atlantic Ocean. I had left Vancouver a few weeks earlier with this moment in my mind. I had made it from sea to sea.

	On any morning Campbellton would have been picturesque but set against the day that was now breaking it was simply glorious. Neat, detached wooden houses sat amidst rolling hillocks that bristled with wild, overgrown grass that swaying back and forth in the breeze from the bay. Campbellton dates from the 1700’s and age has given the town an eternal feeling. I could tell just from looking at it that this was a place where lives had been lived.

	The wind would howl and drive cold, stinging rain against rattling window panes. The alkaline air of the salty sea would chip paint and the moisture would warp floorboards, but the people of Campbellton had endured it all and would continue to endure it regardless. Life would go on as it always had. Campbellton represented shelter from the storm and comfort amidst the wild. I would like to live somewhere like Campbellton.

	As the train trundled past Campbellton it followed the coastline and I began to get the sinking feeling that by overlooking New Brunswick we had made a huge mistake. Occasionally the bare and windswept coast would be swallowed by thick forest that I would eagerly peer into in the hope that I would see a moose through a gap in the trees, I had no such luck.

	Sometimes, if we are very lucky we find a place in the world that the sight of it resonates with us. It is a feeling beyond the mere appreciation of natural beauty; it is something far more fundamental and transcendent, as if something in the very fabric of our being has recognised a comfortable and familiar space, a landscape that mirrors the soul. It is wonderful and it is calming and it feels as if this place was created for you and for you alone. While a train full of people may have passed along that stretch of coastline outside of Campbellton on that Saturday morning I felt as if I was the only one who truly saw it.

	The image of that glorious, winter-bright morning, which was perhaps more bright and clear than any other morning that I have ever experienced, that morning, from the breaking dawn on the Chaleur Bay to the fleeting glimpses of white-capped waves rolling into shore, seen from a train travelling over 100km an hour is one of the most treasured memories that I took home from my entire Canadian adventure.

Paid TEFL Teaching Jobs: Gulf Arab States
(Saudi Arabia, Dubai, Qatar, Oman, Kuwait, Bahrain & Abu Dhabi) – Tremendous oil wealth and a desire to become international players in the economic and political arenas have led the Arab countries of the Persian Gulf region to invest billions of dollars into their educational systems, particularly English language instruction. As a result, qualified English teachers are offered very attractive pay and benefits packages to come to teach.
However, because the number of opportunities is only a fraction of what is found in Asia or Europe, the job market can be exceedingly competitive (an MA and/or a professional background in education is often required for many positions). 

Highlights of working in the Persian Gulf region:

 * Salaries ranging from $2,000 - $5,000 per month (tax-free).
 * Benefits may include free health insurance, furnished housing/housing stipend, and flights to and from your home country.
 * An opportunity to experience a region rich in culture and history.

Positive Outlook for the New Year & 2011 Gap Years
Need help planning a gap year? Oyster Worldwide is a small and well regarded Gap year organisation sending volunteers and paid workers to 11 destinations worldwide.
Despite the sudden hitch in student tuition fees, set to come into practice for the 2012 cohort, travel reviews site TripAdvisor is predicting an increase in gap year travelers over the next year.

TripAdvisor’s annual travel trend’s survey, which spanned 6,200 people from the UK, revealed that two thirds of respondents are planning to take a lot of time out in the New Year.

However this does come at a price. Only 10% of respondents said that they would be taking environmental issues into consideration when planning their trips- in comparison to 14% from the last survey. It is assumed that this is due to the all-important cost cutting methods.

Despite this, it is indeed a positive stance for the New Year. Many people will actually be better off volunteering abroad for several months than their counterparts who stay in the UK looking for work or scarce university places. Developing your CV, your personal experiences and indeed your independence are extremely valuable assets at the moment- so stand out from the crowd and jump on that band wagon!

Primate Gap Year Volunteer Projects Cameroon, Africa
Take a gap year and volunteer with primates. Two of Ape Action Africa's primates received a very special visitor recently - British Neurophysiotherapist Kirsty Godwin-Pearson. At home, Kirsty treats people with neurological conditions, using physiotherapy to aid their recovery and help them regain function. She travelled to Cameroon to work closely with Samburu, a young chimp left paralysed by meningitis and Maggie, a mandrill who suffers severe fits.
In her two weeks at Mefou, Kirsty visited Samburu twice a day for physiotherapy sessions and trained his carer Franklin on techniques that help Samburu use his paralysed arm. The little chimp has made excellent progress and instead of dragging his right arm behind him, he is now using it to feed himself and even climb small trees.

Kirsty also worked with Maggie, a gentle, two-year-old female Mandrill, who suffers from serious fits, poor balance and sensory problems. Maggie’s frequent fitting made it difficult for Kirsty to treat her, but she spent several hours a day in Maggie’s cage, encouraging her to eat using her hands. Until now, Maggie has only been able to eat by lying on her stomach and taking food into her mouth from the floor.

Kirsty is passionate about primate conservation, saying “for a while now I have felt that primates with neurological problems would benefit from neurophysiotherapy in the same way humans do. They are very similar to us...and get very frustrated from not being able to move around and use their limbs normally.”

As far as Ape Action Africa know Kirsty is the first specialist Neurophysiotherapist in the world to have worked with primates and we are grateful for the huge improvements she has made in the lives of Samburu and Maggie.

Some volunteer organizations, charities offer offer volunteer placements at refugee camps and centers in Africa.
Inspire Volunteering offer placements at the Kakuma Refugee Camp volunteer placement in Kenya, Africa.

Volunteering at Kakuma camp for children and refugees: A unique and special project in remote Kenya. Kakuma refugee camp is in the northern corner of Kenya bordering Sudan and Uganda. Juba which is a major town in southern Sudan is only 424km from Kakuma. This refugee camp was as a result of an ensuing war in Sudan. Thousands of Sudanese were given safe haven in Kenya and as a result the UN had to come out to try and empower this people so that they can be enlightened and educated when they get back to their country. Kakuma also has a small town town that in a few years has rapidly grown to a small commercial centre. The area is semi arid and has temperatures that go up to 45c.The indigenous people here are called the Turkanas, they are a nomadic tribe that herds cattle and sheep. They tend to move from one place to the other looking for pasture. Due to these you will notice that their houses are semi permanent. The whole area apart from the UN compound which is basically developed the rest of the area  is encompassed by mud and stick huts. 

Kakuma Refugee Camp is divided into 7 units in a an area of hundreds of square kilometers. This is for purposes of better administration. Kakuma also encompasses other refugees from other countries in the region that have war in their country. These are the Ugandans, Congolise, Somalis and Ethiopians. Currently the UN has been repatriating Sudanese refugees back to their homes on voluntary bases and many have left the camp, because of this they are also transferring Somali Bantus from another camp called Dadaab to Kakuma because of its organization and space left by the Sudanese who went back home.

INTERESTING FACTS ABOUT KAKUMA

Kakuma has very many interesting and attractive things which a volunteer will really find amusing and at times life changing. There are trees that are so poisonous  that one has to be careful  what they touch.. There are snakes and scorpions and one also has to check their rooms well before they sleep.Most interesting aspect is that Kakuma being in lower lands their main water sources are rivers. These rivers flow from Uganda which is bordering Kakuma, so one moment the river beds are dry and the next the water is flowing. This is because Uganda is mountainous and rains a lot.The Turkana community attire which is traditional is also very amazing to see. Most of the children also walk nude because of the very high temperatures. These among the many interesting things you get to see in Kakuma.
	
Volunteering at kakuma camp for children and refugees

This is a school that caters for children between 5 years and 6 years old. It is situated in the heart of the camp. It is a school that offers education to Sudanese refugees from a predominantly large ethnic group called Equatorial tribe from Southern part of Sudan.The school teaches early childhood education using the Kenyan system of education. This was among the very first schools to be constructed in the camp. Most of the children who have gone and become adults and among them the Lost Boys of Sudan went through this school. This school is among 7 pre- schools in the whole of Kakuma camp..

STAFF OF THE SCHOOL

The school has a population of 120 children. It has only 3 teachers including the head teacher. It has 2 support staff, these are a watchman and a cook. All the teachers are from the Sudan community as they are encouraged to work in their own schools thus empowering them for the future of their country

SCHOOL ACTIVITIES

The school due to lack of teaching materials the children use chalk slates. This is never viable and good because they erase the work every time there is a new subject, thus the progress and records of the child is not well monitored..

DUTIES OF SCHOOL TEACHERS AND VOLUNTEERS

- Teachers report at the school at 7.30am.
- Inspection of toilets, classroom and supervision of sweeping of the compound. This is because of the dusty condition of the camp.
- Supervise that the tables and chairs are in place for the commencement of the lessons.
- Tires are also arranged and put into place. These are basically car tires which are used by the children to play with.
- By 8 am, the children are received at the gate. This helps to create an environment of friendliness and care which acts as a motivator for the children to attend class.
- Ringing of the bell where all children assemble for a parade where they pray, and the days activities are communicated to them. It also brings this small community together.
- The children are checked for hygiene. This is for teaching basic cleanliness it includes checking nails, clean clothes, clean groomed faces etc.
- They then go to class and teaching starts. These includes reading, writing , coloring, nursery rhymes etc Note that the volunteer here has to follow the time-table and curriculum offered in the school. Help and assist in anyway possible.
- School breaks at 10 am for a snack and play for around 30 min before they go back to class.
- School breaks at 12.30 pm because there is a lot of heat most activities in the camp almost come to a halt and resume at 3 pm when it gets cooler.
- The volunteer can break for lunch and take a break at the mess then prepare for the next  day after the day cools down. 

FEEDING PROGRAM

The school also has a feeding program where children are given porridge  and biscuits at 10.30 am. This also acts as a motivator for the parents to bring their children to school instead of keeping them at home. Volunteers are encouraged to assist in the making of food and thus be pro active and help the limited staff.

OTHER INFORMATION

The classes are divided into two with 60 children in one classes. This is so because they lack enough  teachers. Most interesting is that they have a lot of space  but they are forced to use only two rooms only. The school head teacher is a very humble lady who works tirelessly to ensure that these children get the best education possible. Due to the repatriation of the refugees to their country the school had been closed down for some time. As a result the school lacks many resources and  they are just working to equip it  again. Another reason that the organization is working very hard to return to normalcy is the upsurge of many refugees from Somali who  are being transferred to Kakuma.

NAPHTALI EMPOWERMENT CENTER

This is a part of a wide network of empowerment activities just in the outskirts of the Kakuma Camp. The community that hosts the refugees in the camp came up with a program where as much as the refugees were getting help the indigenous tribe here also needed education and a lot of empowerment They are a nomadic group and a result were not getting any education because of moving around. The area semi-arid these people rarely lived in one place at a given time. As a result there was need to start this center. This center has a primary school, an adult literacy class, a child worker trainee school or teacher training, a feeding program for the children and the community, a small bush school for children who are unable to access the school and a church for spiritual guidance. It also has started a small children orphanage  with  11 children   living in a semi-permanent structure made of mud. Recently the structure fell apart and the children are now living in the local pastors house temporarily.

These activities below encompass the Empowerment center. Again volunteers can engage with this as much as possible and in any way required.

ECHAMI LEARNING CENTER

School is located on the out skirts of the camp. This means it is not in the camp. The school however caters for both Refugees and indigenous Turkana children. The schools run by a network of community leaders and members. These include the local church, the local pastor, formers teachers of the refugee camps and the community itself. The school caters for 165 children and has a total of 7 teachers. It also has 4 supports staff that include cooks.The population of the school is mostly Turkana with Sudanese, Rwandese, and  Burundi refugees. It has 4 classes  which are from standard 1 to 4. It is run using the Kenyan education curriculum. The volunteer must also in this case be able to  work around this system which is mostly basic education. 

ACTIVITIES OF THE SCHOOL

- School starts at 8 am every day where the children attend an assembly before going to class.
- Classes start and the children  attend lessons until 10.30 am. The lessons involve   English as a language, Math, Science, Social Studies which include History, Geography, and Christian Religious Education.
- They  then break at 10.30 am for tea and porridge.
- They then return to class for classes until 12.30 where lunch is served for the children. Because none of the children go home for lunch and the support staff is not enough, the teachers are called upon to help in this exercise. So the volunteer will also be able to help and work together with the teachers.
- The children then attend classes at around 2.30 because the heat is too much and  attend more classes until  4 pm.
- They then have ball games on alternative days or attend clubs. These clubs would be like debate clubs where the children enact a parliament and debate on various issues which their little minds can comprehend. This is very interesting because you are left amazed by how bright these children are.
- The school then winds up for the day and the children run home to their small villages. 

FACILITIES OF THE SCHOOL

- They have 7 classrooms.
- A  semi-permanent kitchen
- A staff room
- A head teachers office
- Church that serves the whole community and happens to be the largest building.
- Pit latrines or pit toilets that are used by the children and teachers
- A run down semi-permanent building that used to house the orphans. 

CONSTRAINTS OF THE SCHOOL

a.    Text books are a problem as the school is unable to provide for them and the parents are very poor that they cannot afford them
b.    Exercise books
c.    Pens and pencils
d.    Uniforms for the orphans
e.    Games materials which would include  footballs, netball's, skipping ropes, and basketball
f.    Tanks to store water for the kitchen as they have to look for water from rivers
g.    Buckets and basins for serving food to the kids

i.    Shoes for the orphans

Also note that unlike other schools Echami Center runs throughout the year expect December holidays. Over August holidays the volunteer will be able to teach and interact with the other programs that are ongoing at these period.

FEEDING PROGRAM

The feeding program is basically funded by the community through the church and well wishers. The program caters for the children and their families. Most of the community around the school cannot afford 3 meals a day. Most of them are very poor and the majority are refugees. The program is able to provide cooking flour  to the community and the children. The program works throughout the week. On weekends they go to the bush  school to feed the children who are still tied down by the cultures of their ethnic group. Most of these kids herd cattle the whole week and are only able to attend school on weekends.The feeding program on weekend also cater for  children from neighboring schools who come to the center on the weekends.

ADULT LITERACY CLASS

Turkana community having have lived for many  years following their cultural practices. Most of the adults never had a chance to an education. As  a result most of these people are illiterate.  When the refugees came to their vicinity with the UN and other organizations they were made aware of the need of an education. The class also attracted  refugees  and the program became very successful. The program still has its challenges which include small attendance when the adults think they can read and write. The main aim of the program is to teach basic English language and to read and write. The class does not run like normal school as they have their own program. It from August to December .It also only operates for only one hour per day. They are approximately 30 students at any given time .

CHILD WORKER TRAINING OR TEACHER TRAINING

This program was started by the teachers in the Echami Center. They came up with a conclusion that what the whole community lacked was a qualified teachers. Most of the schools in these area have many children who are seeking for an education but the ratio of teachers to pupils was not viable. Most of the schools have to look for volunteers or cannot afford to pay teachers. The Echami community therefore decided to come together and train these child workers. They are taught how to handle and teach children. At the end of their training they are able to teach and psychologically able to handle these children. The teachers attend classes over the holidays which are 3 months of the year. These months are April, August and December. Note that the volunteers who choose these time will be involved in the program.

POKOTOM  BUSH SCHOOL AND FEEDING PROGRAMME

This is a very interesting program. Although it is run only one day a week it is a very amazing and fun experience to get involved in. The school is basically under a tree and in inside the bush in the mountains of Turkana. The school is run by the Naphtali Empowerment Center. The school caters for the very traditional  of the Turkana group. The Pokotom project have to bring food with them so that they can attract the community to the school. The children are in proper traditional attire which is basically a beaded necklace on the waist without any loin cloth for the boys and a  cloth wrap and necklaces for the girls. Most of these children move around so much as they are a nomadic tribe that the center is trying also to enlighten the parents on the need of education and that is why the program uses feeding as way to congregate them so that they can create awareness on the importance of education.

ACTIVITIES OF THE SCHOOL

- The food is prepared  for transportation. Remember this only happens on Saturdays only.
- The food is then loaded onto bicycles for transportation. This is because  there are simply no roads so cars cannot be used
- The volunteer and the child workers then ride the bicycles to the bush. The volunteer has to be accompanied at all times to the school.
- They get to the place where they have reserved for the school and start lessons.
- The food is then given to the children.
- The distribution of the food to the community is done every fortnight
- They also organize sports for the  children . 

CONSTRAINTS

There is a need to simply construct a make shift class at least to cover the children from the very hot sun.

- Iron sheets for the small structure
- Nails
- Timber
- Books
- Pens and pencils
- Food for the program that includes flour, maize and beans.
- Text books 

HIV AND AIDS TESTING AND VOLUNTARY COUNSELING CENTER

HIV/AIDS in Africa has become a  pandemic. It has especially affected the refugees  because they are coming from a place that has war so they were not very well sensitized. Apart from that the camp has its own social difficulties that fuel the spread if the pandemic. A Voluntary Counseling and Testing Clinic is a  place where patients go and  test for the virus and at the same time time go through counseling. These clinics were opened all over Kenya to encourage people to know their status. It has been hugely successful with thousands of people attending them.

ACTIVITIES OF THE CENTER

In the Kakuma Camp it also doubles as a mobile Clinic  where the personnel at the clinic travel the vast camp see patients who are bedridden with AIDS and advising them on home-based care. These clinics are free and are funded by the government and the organizations in the camp. They also holds meeting with the refugees to create awareness on the disease. This include behavior change among the  refugees. It is important because they  have a lot of cultures that help fuel the spread of HIV. The center will also go to the homes and have what they call home level counseling and testing. The center also offers Prevention of mother to child transmission or popularly known as PMTCT. This is where they treat and offer information on how not to transmit the virus to an unborn child. Early attendance for ante-natal care and testing will help prevent these. They also offer Anti Retro viral Treatment or ARV. This is administering drugs so that the virus does not multiply and also the right foods to eat. This is the most important life saving mechanism that has been very effective to patients. It is currently prolonging many lives as patients are now living very positively.

They are also taking care of  orphans and vulnerable children who have been infected and affected by HIV/AIDS. Due to the virus affecting the body immune system TB or tuberculosis is very prevalent. They also run a very effective program for treatment and management of these disease.

Sexually transmitted diseases also fuel the spread of the virus so they also run an awareness and treatment program for these. Every week on Wednesday the center distributes condoms on dispensers that have been put around the camp. This is a condom promotion that helps in  creating awareness of safe sex. Apart from the above activities the mobile clinic makes up to 30-45 home visits every day. This is done in the afternoon as in the morning they counsel around 6 people every day who come for a first testing intervention.

FACILITIES OF THE  CENTER

- A waiting area  or reception with literature on HIV/AIDS. These is also the first time to come into contact with the patient. It also used for quality assurance. It is also the mobilization room. 

- The  next room is what is called the counseling room where the counselor  takes the patient through the counseling process. This prepares them on how to take the test.

- The next room is where the test is administered and they keep records and charts on the  entire program. 

STAFF

They have 10 members of staff that cover all the zones  in the camp.

Rhino Gap Year Conservation Programs Africa
Luxury African travel company Mahlatini has launched a new campaign to support Rhino conservation in Africa. The travel retailer which is based in Belfast has teamed up with the Amakhala Game Reserve, in South Africa to help raise awareness of the serious issue of illegal Rhino poaching; which is pushing Black and White Rhinos to the brink of extinction making them an endangered species.
Amakhala, a unique conservation initiative that allows animals to be re-introduced to the area where they once roamed freely, is one of the stunning African destinations Mahlatini operate holidays to. The Mahlatini team have all lived or travelled extensively in Africa and are passionate about the continent. The company’s name is even a Zulu word meaning ‘love of the African bush’. They are committed to supporting the excellent and vital work that Amakhala and other conservation projects conduct in order to preserve the continent’s beautiful landscape and wildlife. 

Greg Fox of Mahlatini said ‘We are extremely proud to support the extraordinary and essential work of Amakhala and raise awareness of other conservation efforts in Africa. In 2009 in South Africa alone, 122 Rhinos were butchered for their horns and the figure nearly tripled in 2010. As an organisation that benefits from the beauty of this amazing continent it’s only right that we use our profile and position to help raise awareness of this delicate situation. Otherwise, future generations will not be able to experience seeing this unique and fascinating animal in its natural environment –only in zoos.’ 

In order to assist in raising awareness of this crisis the Mahlatini team have sponsored one of Amakhala’s baby Rhinos, Themba, which means ‘hope’ in Zulu. To celebrate the new addition to their team and elevate the profile of the struggle against Rhino poachers Mahalatini has launched a competition with Rhino sponsorship packages as prizes. 

Entrants are required to simply spread the word through social media – on a blog or website, or through Facebook and Twitter. They can enter via all three methods and the winners will receive a whole host of benefits including a cuddly toy Rhino, a fact book and regular updates on their Rhino. 

The campaign will run until 20th May 2011 and more information on the competition, Rhino conservation and poaching can be found on the Mahlatini website www.mahlatini.com/stop-rhino-poaching.

Media enquiries: Victoria Yates on 0845 862 0416 (ext 7021) or victoriay@wmps.com

Mahlatini is a luxury travel operator specialising in trips to Africa. Named after the Zulu word meaning ‘lover of the African bush’ the company operates holidays to 13 African countries including Botswana, South Africa, Kenya and Mauritius.

The company, which is based in Belfast, Northern Ireland has been operating for over 9 years and is a division of Luxury Travel Ltd. Mahlatini is a member of the Travel Trust Association, ATOL and Advancing Tourism to Africa (ATTA).

	Cambodia is one of the most underrated countries to go diving in Asia, whether you are a complete beginner or have already been diving before you will be able to find a course or package to match your needs. Search dive packages with the best dive centers in Cambodia today.


	A Guide to Going Diving in Cambodia

	

	Cambodia is a very enjoyable place to either learn to dive, or join an advanced course/trip. Water temperatures average around 28°C year round and if you are lucky you might get to see moray eels, reef sharks, sea turtles and whale sharks. What makes Cambodia such an appealing dive destination is that there are new dive sites found every week, and the waters around the South coast have still to be explored! Compared to other countries where you can find it difficult to move with the amount of tourists/divers. 

	 

	Top Reasons to Go Diving in Cambodia

	

	
		Cambodia attracts a lot less tourists than Thailand meaning the dive sites in the country are a lot less crowded
	
		The cost of the courses here are very cheap compared to some destinations in Asia
	
		See spectacular wildlife and coral
	
		Relax on some of the most incredible islands and beaches on the continent
	
		Make new friends and experience a new country/culture 
	
		The local food is delicious
	
		Do more than just sunbathing!


	 

	Best Places to Go Diving in Cambodia

	

	Koh Koun and Koh Rong Samloem are probably the most popular dive site located about 1-2 hours away from Sihanoukville and close to Koh Rong Samleom. There are beginners dive trips, advanced excursions and also night dives available here, dive depth range from 3m – 25m and visibility is usually good, around 3m – 15m. One of the reasons this area is so popular is because is is a protected marine site, due to local conservation efforts the coral, marine flora and fauna is very healthy. Local dive centres also offer overnight dive trips to remote dive sites around Koh Tang, Koh Prins and Koh Pulawei.

	 

	Scuba Diving in Sihanoukville

	

	If you are thinking about staying or and going diving in Sihanoukville we have put together some useful information which should help you.

	You can travel by private/public bus from Siem Reap or Phnom Penh to Sihanoukville. The journey from Siem Riep takes about 10 hours so you will need to leave early in the morning or catch an overnight transport. There are plenty of interesting stops along the way making for an exciting journey...choices include a visit to a bamboo sticky rice cake making workshop or Spider town (harbouring…you guessed it, tarantulas!!) 

	Most people stay close to the beach in Sihanoukville (as seen above). We also recommend going to stay on the island of Koh Rong Samloem. Accommodation can be included in the price of some dive packages or you can just find somewhere independently, there are great value beach bungalows, hotels and hostels available.

	You’ll have the opportunity to take part in one of the many local activities – try visiting waterfalls, or taking a trip out to one of the nearby islands to enjoy a great day of snorkelling in the beautiful clear blue waters. In the evenings, enjoy Sihanoukville’s night life and join in on optional dinners with your group and later visit some of the many local bars for a game of pool, a cocktail or 10, up to you, or just let loose on the dance floor!

		EcoSea Dive; Sihanoukville
	
		Koh Kong Divers Resort; Koh Totang Island
	
		The Dive Shop; Serendipity Beach Rd, Sihanoukville


	How to Choose a Dive Centre in Cambodia:

	
		With so many dive shops and resorts in Sihanoukville and Koh Rong it can be hard to know which is the best one to make a booking with. Most dive centres offer similar services and packages but each is different in one way or another. To help you make a decision you might want to consider the following questions:
	
		Courses / Facilities:

		Money:
	
		
			What is the cost of the course?
		
			Does the package include all equipment?
		
			Is accommodation included in the price and what is it like? Is there a kitchen or wifi?
		
			Are there any added bonuses like “fun” dives included?
		
			If I pay with a credit card is there an additional fee?
		
			Are any discounts offered?.
	


	 

	Top Rated Dive Sites in Cambodia

	Some companies offer fantastic scuba diving opportunities where you can get trained as a scuba diver and also help marine conservation efforts. This is a really rewarding way to volunteer in Cambodia and spend a holiday having a big impact on helping the local eco system and marine life.

	What Makes Australia Such a Great Place to Work In?

	Australia often tops the list of “best countries to live” or having the “highest quality of life,” what is it that makes Australia such a great place to live? It is hard to pin it down to just one or two things, but here are some of the common answers you will find after talking to Australians. You will love the outdoors lifestyle - Australians are relatively fit, and they can do so because they live in a country that affords them decent weather year-round. Whether it is a day at the beach, a morning hike or an afternoon gathered around the “barbie” (barbeque), Australians have plenty of fresh air in their lungs.

	There is a very stable economy, there will always be someone without a job or having a rough time – but overall, the Australian economy has proven stable and resilient over the years. The unemployment rate in Australia is relatively low and Australia’s government is ever-mindful of keeping things in alignment. Working here is also a good way to meet people, Australians are social creatures – a look at a restaurant or backyard any month of the year will tell you. Several studies have asked centenarians (people who lived to be 100 years old) why they lived so long, and the answers are unanimous: they had good friends. Now, there’s no guarantee you’ll live to be 100 years old in Australia, but you’ll certainly have friends along the way. Fact: Australia’s average life expectancy is 82 years according to World Bank’s data.

	According to UNESCO data, Australians tend to stay in school a bit longer than their American or British counterparts, and most would say the overall education system in Australia is top quality. This helps attract good employers as well as entrepreneurs and you will learn a lot from working here. In your spare time you will also get to explore the country, whether it’s the Great Barrier Reef, Uluru, the Kimberleys, or the endless beaches found on the east and west coasts, Australians have landscapes that can cheer you up even on your worst day. That, combined with the aforementioned tendency to be outdoors anyway, means Australians are even more in touch with their surroundings. Now that you know more about Australia, read more information below about if you qualift to here here. 

	 

	 

	
		Visa Eligibility & Requirements
	
		Established in 1975 the Australian visa provides people with the opportunity to live and gain employment in Australia. The visa restrictions have been relaxed in recent years to provide any past or present visa holder who has spent a minimum of three months working in Australia to apply for a second visa. 
	
		The visa must be validated within one year of being granted the visa and it allows people to stay up to 12 months from the date of first entry, you can even leave the country and return it will not affect the visa status. If you are in Australia on a work visa you will be entitled to the same pay and work conditions as Australian nationals. You also have the option of leaving the employer at any time and looking for fresh employment. 
	
		These visas are relatively quick to obtain, making them popular with young people travelling before moving on to the next stage of their working or educational lives. There is also a skilled migration visa. The General Skilled Migration (GSM) programme is the only way for skilled workers to emigrate to Australia, but in order to qualify for this visa applicants must first meet the basic requirements for GSM and pass the Australian immigration points test, which scrutinises skill, age, work experience, language and sponsorship requirements. Whilst skilled independent visas are for people who can offer an immediate skills boost to the country and is the most popular skilled immigration process. Skilled sponsored is another route; this is where a skilled worker has family residing in Australia or who is sponsored by an Australian state or territory. Skill shortages are a common way to gain entry into the country; jobs and skills that are in short supply can be filled by people from other countries including the UK.
	
		Unfortunately, you can’t just arrive unannounced and expect a warm welcome and the purpose of a working holiday visa is to allow you to work to cover funds for your travel. You’ll need to get permission from Australia’s Department of Immigration and Citizenship, they issue two different types of these visas, depending on your nationality. Most European nations and countries that are part of the British Commonwealth may apply for a subclass 417 visa, while Americans, some South American nationals, and a few Asian nationals may apply for a subclass 462 visa.  It’s important to check the official lists on the department’s website so you do not apply for the incorrect visa.  The application fee is $365 AUD (correct as of May-13) and is not refundable if your application is refused.
	
		417 Visa - If you are eligible for a 417 visa, you may stay in Australia for up to 12 months, working up to six months with each employer you choose, and you are allowed to enter and exit the country freely.  This visa can also be extended for a second working holiday visa, which adds another 12 months to your stay. 417 visa applicants must be 18-30 years old and will need to pass a medical examination, meet character requirements (no serious law violations in the past), and have proof of financial support. It is generally advised to have at least $5,000 AUD, if not more.
	
		462 Visa - The 462 visa requirements are almost identical to the 417 visa requirements, although certain additional criteria are made depending on your country of citizenship.  For example, American passport holders must have a high school diploma or equivalent qualification.
	
		Working holiday visas are processed quickly, typically within a week – though you may need to be interviewed or take a physical exam, which can extend the processing time.  Do not make any non refundable arrangements until you have an approved visa! Once your visa has been approved, you’ll want to book your flight and start the planning process. You do not need to book a round-trip flight when you start your working holiday, but you must be able to prove – if asked – that you have the funds to buy your ticket home. The hardest part of your working holiday in Australia is ensuring that you meet all of the criteria for the application process, and following the instructions exactly. Remember, fees for denied application fees are not refundable. Once you’re approved?  Then buy a new hat and some sun cream – you’re off to Australia!
	
		 
	
		 
	
		 
	
		


	Where to Seek Employment

	While the bulk of Australia’s population lives in the southeast, near urban hubs like Sydney and Melbourne, you can also reside in a small town and work on a farm, a vineyard, a small hotel or get involved in the mining industry.

	Hospitality Jobs in Australia

	Working in Australia is a brilliant way to really experience the true culture and finance your trip. Just be prepared for some red tape and a few hoops to jump through before winning that first job. Seasonal fruit-picking jobs in Australia are very influenced by the seasonal conditions for that particular crop. Weather and natural disasters like droughts, fires and floods can and do have a huge impact on the availability and length of employment for casual workers. 

	Many travellers have realized that landing jobs in major cities is much easier, especially in the hospitality sector. Plus it’s not your traditional 9-5 grind. You’ll get enough of that when you return home.  Hospitality hours let you see the sights and soak up the sunshine while most other people are at work! However, securing work in places such as cafés, bars and restaurants is not just a matter of turning up at the door. Australian workers are required to undertake some training and gain certain qualifications to uphold service and safety standards.  In regards to service of alcohol, it’s not just a matter of employer preference; it’s a government imposed and regularly policed legal requirement!

	Here I will give some helpful tips on how to get a head start on your competition, find a job easily and concentrate on the fun stuff!

	First things first…
	Make sure you have the correct legal status for working in Australia. This means having applied and been granted a Working Holiday Visa. Yes, employers will ask. There are heavy penalties for employers found with illegal workers and most won’t take the risk.

	Resume
	Update your resume to target the type of job you are after. Hospitality employers will be looking for skills and experience in areas such as food preparation, mixing drinks, cleaning, cash handling, customer service, coffee making, ability to speak different languages and basic computer literacy. Include genuine references from your previous employers; these are all too easy to follow up. If there are restrictions on your time, be precise about the days and the hours you will be able to work.

	Training
	If you want to work in any job serving, supplying or selling alcohol in Australia you will need to complete the Responsible Service of Alcohol (RSA) training. This certificate is mandatory across Australia but beware, each state has it’s own liquor legislation; you may need to complete training for each state you plan to work in. Prefer the heat of the kitchen? A technical training course like the Certificate II in Kitchen Operations can give you a terrific head start, especially if you are new to food preparation. Love coffee? Consider doing a barista course where you learn cutting edge tricks like etching and free pouring. Café work is a great option for those that do prefer to work in the daytime.

	Finding work
	You will find job offers on general recruitment websites like Seek as well as those that target specific industry sectors like hotelcareersaustralia.com.au. It’s also worth contacting some major hotel and entertainment venues directly such as The Star in Sydney or any major convention and exhibition centre such as The National Convention Centre in Canberra or in the particular city you are visiting or living. These companies need a large and constant number of staff all year round. Whilst a working holiday can seem like the ideal way to fund your travels, it will go a lot smoother if you do your research and get somewhat prepared before you head Down Under. Then, a smile, neat presentation and a positive attitude should take you the rest of the way. Good luck!

	Computing & IT Jobs

	Recruitment firms have discovered that Australia’s information technology sector remains the third most confident market in the country in terms of projected demand for hiring permanent staff over the course of the next three months. Great news if you’re planning on spending significant time Down Under and looking to work here! ​Australian recruitment agency Hudson found that almost half the country’s employers (48.1 per cent) have plans to increase their number of staff performing IT jobs. This upswing in confidence was only outdone in the professional services and resources sectors. Hudson’s review reflected the confident opinions of over 4,300 employers ranging across the whole of Australia. Of those surveyed, even those who didn’t plan to take on more staff were still in a stable position, as 43.6 per cent of respondents said that they anticipated the number computer jobs would remain steady over this quarterly period.

	Hudson’s Asia Pacific chief financial officer Mark Leigh said: "Despite the current international uncertainty, and changing conditions at home, employment expectations in Australia on the whole remain positive, particularly in the resources, transport and construction and engineering sectors," "Furthermore, we expect high demand in certain roles, such as engineering, geology, health & safety executives and operational roles, as well as for customer facing IT specialists,’’ he said. Increased confidence in this sector is fast becoming a phenomenon felt all around the eastern part of the world. The increased short - and medium-term employment opportunities in Australia provided by many new projects, has meant that many IT workers are also willing to pursue IT contract jobs and enjoy the higher flexibility and pay. Maybe it’s time to start searching ahead for that lucrative role Down Under that will provide for a fantastic trip, with all of the perks paid for. You will find positions in all the major cities across the country.

	 

	 

	

	Winter Ski Jobs in Australia

	Work a winter ski season in Australia? Really? Yes. This is a country of contrast, in summer you could work as a surf instructor and during the winter period from around June to October you could seek employment in places like the Snowy Mountains in New South Wales. There are 4 different resorts operational here for beginners and more advanced levels and the close proximity to Sydney make both working or just going skiing / snowboarding. Jobs can be found on the slopes e.g. working as a ski lift operator or general assistant, or there are also lots of shops, restaurants and accommodation which hire winter seasonal staff. Mount Buller (as seen in the picture above) is another popular location for winter jobs, this area is just three hours north-east of Melbourne. The types of jobs available here are in operations, resort services, hospitality and leading lessons. You might also be able to work during summer or a few months before June getting everything ready for the busy ski season.

	Accommodation

	If you are applying for employment independently then you should be able to arrange your own accommodation. Living conditions can be basic unless you spend a lot or rent your own place. You can stay cheaply in dorm rooms and this is a good opportunity to socialize and really get to know people. Other times you could get your own room, kitchen facilities and privacy. Local staff are very friendly and should be able to help you find something. You will need to decide how long to stay, a lot of people choose 3 months but others day over a year - this time really allows you to settle into a placement. Some jobs include free board and accommodation e.g. working on a farm.

	 

	 

	

	Wages

	One of the biggest deciding factors, and one of the main reasons for the large number of people making the move to Australia, is the appeal of avoiding Europe&#39;s and some other worldwide countries economic situation. Australia has really high wages, even for entry level or non-skilled jobs. The minimum wage is around $550 per week.

Spain Gap Year

	Taking a gap year in Spain is a popular choice for many reasons, not least the fabulous food, relaxed yet diverse culture, the historical heritage and the thriving art and culture scene mixed in with sun, sea and sand. From the vibrant and busy cities such as Barcelona and Madrid, to the sleepy, quiet villages in Andalucia, Spain has a diverse range of cultures to experience. On our website you can find programs for students, graduates, career breaks and people wanting to do something different. Expect a good value destination where you can go in search of history and culture, or just head to the coast for a relaxed beach life. View backpacking trips and structured placements like Spanish language lessons / courses, adventure gap year experiences and more. 


	Have the Spanish Adventure of a Lifetime on Your Gap Year

	Of all the potential gap year locations in Europe, Spain is perhaps one of the most popular choices. Offering everything from volunteering in Ibiza to cultural internships in Madrid to conversational Spanish classes in San Sebastian, Spain offers great places to live, work and study as well as to visit on weekends and holidays. No gap year in Spain would be complete without a trip to the Canary Islands for Tenerife holidays, or a jaunt to Majorca for a well-earned break.

	 

	Culture

	Spanish culture is rich and varied. Characterised largely by its laid back attitude and historical heritage, it manages to seamlessly blend old and new which has resulted in one of the most vibrant and interesting art and culture scenes in Europe set in and amongst some of the continent&#39;s most historical cultural facilities and architecture. From modern metropolises like Madrid and Barcelona to sleepier spots like Andalucía or San Sebastian, the Iberian culture has something for everyone at varying paces of life. Gap years in Spanish cities are sure to stir the soul and inspire new and interesting ideas while experiences with more of a focus on surfing and sunbathing on the coast are not to be underestimated.

	 

	Food & Drink

	One of the most important parts of a cultural immersion is through culinary exploration. A gap year is designed to get people out of their comfort zone and challenge them to try new things. The experience of Spanish food is about more than just flavour. The act of preparing food with love and patience, the ritual of eating small plates over long hours and the casual yet sophisticated incorporation of wine into most meals all make the culinary culture of the country an important part of such an experience. Taste the flavours of different regions by traveling around the country or experience the cooking of a local family while working as an au pair.

	 

	Exploration

	Gap years are more than just a few months in a place you choose to work or study. With incredible access to all corners of the country, including some more distant island paradises; experiencing the marvel that is a Spanish holiday is made infinitely easier thanks to proximity and connectedness. There will never be a better time to jet off to Tenerife for a long weekend in the Canary Islands or explore the rugged mountains of Extremadura. Experience the Ibiza nightlife or run with the bulls in Pamplona for a taste of the wilder side, or retreat to the beautiful Basque countryside for cooking classes and other cultural activities. Gap years are an incredible way to really indulge the amazing adventures of youth between serious stints as a student or full time employee. Choosing the perfect destination is no easy feat. With such a diverse range of choices facing young people, selecting the perfect setting for one of the best years of your life takes careful consideration, so why not consider everything that Spain can offer you?

	 

	Gap Year Jobs in Spain

	If you’re after a steady gap year job then there are plenty of options for you, during which you’ll be able to immerse yourself in Spanish culture and perfect your Spanish speaking skills. If you need to work while you’re away, it can be a good idea to secure a position somewhere and spend a few months there, before taking the opportunity to backpack around for a few months. For many students, this would be the ideal mix of work and travel, all the while enabling them to fund it themselves and experience something completely different.

	It’s possible to work your way around the country in hospitality, for example. There are many websites that will help you get a waitressing, catering or bar job somewhere in Spain, which can then kick start your year of adventuring. It is possible to pick up casual work this way and fund your adventures backpacking. If teaching is your thing, then you could find a place teaching English to adults or children, again there are plenty of programmes to help you find these. You will most likely need a TEFL qualification and once you have this it will also open up many avenues to you for further travel in the future. Positions can be found at language schools, summer camps and leading private lessons.

	 

	Study Spanish

	A lot of Spanish people speak English but that doesn&#39;t mean they all do so its best to take a phrase book or learn basic Spanish especially if joining an internship or program. The good news is this is one of the easier languages to pick up, you can also book a language course, check our recommended language school via the banner below. 

	

	 

	Backpacking in Spain

	Spain is a great country to learn to surf or live for a longer period and take part in an exciting gap year program, each area of the country offers a different experience, you could experience one of the many great year round festivals, spend time exploring cities or even travel through more countries overland in this region. Some people head South to Morocco whilst you can also join trips on a gap year in Portugal. A lot of people learn Spanish in Spain, there are Spanish classes and language schools in places like Barcelona, Madrid, Valencia, Málaga, Salamanca and Seville. 

	These are just a few of the activities on offer though, you could volunteer or join an organised overland adventure trip. On our website we have featured gap year programs available which can be joined all year round. For these you will usually need to pay a fee which covers placements, transfers, accommodation and meals for the duration of your stay. To apply for a gap year program you will need to be eligible for a tourist visa, most Nationalities are able to apply. It is best to book a couple of months in advance to, this is a popular year round destination and spaces can fill up quickly.

	It’s best to do a lot of research and planning before leaving on your gap year, take note of working requirements for example, and cover your communications well. Making sure you have a good data roaming plan on your phone is a good idea, as you can get caught out with huge bills just for hopping online a couple of times. Being safe is just as important as being adventurous so make sure you’re always in contact with someone back home if you’re travelling alone, or get a group together of trusted companions for extra safety - and fun!

		Accommodation: There are a high standard of hotels, hostels and guest houses located throughout the country, prices are quite cheap in comparison with other European destinations. Spanish accommodation is medium priced, generally a hostel dorm bed will cost you around £10 ($15) per night, if you go in winter or out of summer you will pay less. Try to book accommodation well in advance as its much cheaper. A private room in a hostel or hotel will cost you around £25 - £40 ($35 - $50) per night and it really depends on where you are. In Barcelona, Madrid and Valencia are more expensive than smaller towns and cities. An idea if there is a couple of you travelling, instead of staying in a dorm book a twin room this sometimes is cheaper especially if you stay more than a few days. 
		 
	
		Cost: Spain is a very good value for money destination, accommodation, food, transport and sightseeing. The more expensive places include Barcelona and Madrid which are the two main cities. One of your biggest costs will probably be drinking alcohol so if you can avoid / cut back on this you will save a lot of money. You will probably spend less money on a gap year in Spain than other countries in Europe, accommodation and food seem cheaper and there are lots of way to save money. Some places in Spain are a lot more expensive than others, for example IIbiza during summer can cost you a  fortune, hotels, food, drink and going out is really high. Whilst other destinations like Benidorm are a lot cheaper.
		 
	
		Food & Drink: Spain has some of the best food in Europe, there are usually great deals on lunch time where restaurants cut the prices. Try the local paella and seafood you won&#39;t be disappointed. Spain has really tasty food, paella is a local favorite but isn&#39;t to everyone tastes. Expect to pay around £5 - £10 for a meal in a restaurant ($7 - $12). Please note if you get drinks, beer or cocktails with your food you can easily spend £20 ($25). If you are looking for cheap food out, lunch is your best bet, most of the Spanish people eat really late at night so restaurants can be busy and overpriced. During lunch there are usually good deals on meals with rates slashed. If you are looking to save as much money as possible then get your food at supermarkets or local markets, you could make sandwiches and fruit which will work out a lot cheaper than eating our everyday.
		 
	
		Transport: Spain has a quick and efficient transport network meaning you can travel throughout the country relatively easily. Transport is fairly cheap but you have to remember how big a country Spain is, we recommend taking the bus to get around which will save you a lot of money but the journey time will be longer. Buses are safe and there are also cheap overnight services. Trains are quick but very expensive. The metro in cities is cheap too compared to cities like London, usually a single trip costs around £1 - £1.50 ($1 - $3). You can also join a gap year tour


	
		Health & Safety: Spain is a very modern country and has world class hospital and health facilities but please always buy travel insurance to be on the safe side. There are no specific vaccinations you will need to enter Spain. Petty theft and pick-pocketing is a problem in some places in Spain, be careful around tourist hot spots like La Rambla in Barcelona always keep an eye on your belongings. On party islands like Ibiza burglaries are a problem, try to keep important belongings like your passport and money in a safe in reception. When there are festivals and celebrations like New Year always keep your bag / camera in sight, lots of people watch fireworks for example and then open their bag to find belongings gone.

Teach English in Cambodia

	While Thailand remains popular with many foreign teachers, Cambodia has benefited from the exposure and limelight their south-eastern neighbour has received in recent years. Cambodia has witnessed growth in tourism over the past decade, with the number of visitors to the region increasing by 15 per cent over that period; many of whom embark on a job teaching English.

Acquiring proficiency in English is a great way in which Cambodian youth and adults can pass exams, graduate from school, go on to secure employment in areas like tourism, and actively participate in Cambodia&#39;s developing modern society.

	"My students were so friendly, they didn&#39;t speak very good English but were so keen to learn every day. Be prepared for basic classroom materials and take as many things from home as you can e.g. paper, pens etc. I feel I gained the respect and gratitude of all the local teachers and I really was able to help for the 2 months I was in Cambodia. I couldn&#39;t recommend this experience highly enough."  - C Adams, USA 

	"The children were so upbeat and their positive attitude really helps you enjoy the experience. Some days were tough and challenging but you also get a lot of free time during the week to see more of your surroundings. I didn&#39;t really know what to expect when I applied but I really enjoyed my time in Cambodia - it is such a beautiful country. Be sure to head to the beaches and also see Angor Wat.&#39; - K Wilson, UK

Teach English in Egypt

	Apply to work as an English teacher in Egypt and experience this magical and unique country for yourself. Search language schools and companies offering TEFL jobs throughout Egypt.


	Guide to Teaching in Egypt

	If you are looking to experience life in a country which has recently been through a historic period in its history and has a bright future ahead then you might really enjoy living and teaching in Egypt. Expect culture and lots of places to visit in your spare time, Egypt is one of the oldest civilizations in the world and seeing the Pyramids is a must. There’s a recognised demand for English in Egypt, it’s a great time to relocate if you want to teach English as a foreign language. 

	Many graduates take a year out after their studies before following their career path, a lot of them try to see more of the world by finding work as a language teacher in a foreign country like Egypt. Some don’t just stay for a year, though: they stay indefinitely and even set up their own language school, thiis country will appeal to you if you are looking to experience a totally different culture. 

	Egypt is home to the stunning Pyramids of Giza – one of the most important archaeological sites on earth as well as one of the most famous tourist attractions, and a definite inclusion on any ‘must-see’ list – this is a country where ancient history mixes with the present everywhere you go. From the busy, bustling streets of Cairo to the splendour of the Nile, the amazing sights of ancient Luxor and the many other sites of historic interest, teaching jobs in Egypt invariably offer an experience like no other. There is so much to take in, and so much choice, that it can take months of living and working here to fully experience the land of the pharaohs.

	 

	Where to Find Teaching Jobs in Egypt

	You can find English teaching jobs in places like:

	
		Alexandria
	
		Cairo
	
		Dahab
	
		Sharm El Sheik


	 

	Best Time to Find ESL Employment in Egypt

	All year round with most recruiters hiring in January and September.

	 

	What is Included in Job Packages

	Most jobs will not include airfare, accommodation and meals. Also it will be difficult to find a job with paid holidays. If you are a single female is it worth considering if Egypt is a good destination for you, there is a culture in this region where jobs are usually given to men.

	 

	Cost of Living

	The general low cost of living in Egypt makes it easier to manage your personal finance, leaving you to reap the full rewards from your teaching job. The general cost of living is fairly low in Egypt for TEFL teachers. Electricity bills, for instance, cost roughly the equivalent of $15 per month and petrol prices are reasonably low. Eating out is also affordable and cheaper than teaching English in Israel or other nearby countries.

	 

	Salary

	Wages are usually lower in Egypt compared to other countries in the Middle East like Dubai but they are usually the highest in North Africa. Expect around 5,000- 12,000 Egyptian Pounds (EGP) per month this is around £500 ($700). Leading private lessons pays the best and even in these turbulent times there are still lots of jobs on offer.

	Also don’t forget when you’re making a living from teaching you will have to manage your personal finances while you’re out there as well. This includes your tax affairs and coping with the general cost of living. Businesses that are based in Egypt must pay tax on all of their worldwide income, with a corporation tax on all company profits. They must file their tax return within four months of the end of the tax year. If you live in Egypt for more than 183 days per year, you must pay income tax. This is as much as 25% on income over 10 million Egyptian pounds per year. Register there as a resident for tax purposes to avoid double taxation. 

	 

	Safety

	Please check latest travel advice before departing or e-mail us for advice about teaching English abroad in Egypt.

	 

	How to Get a TEFL Job in Egypt

	Remember that even though you’ve come to teach English, you should also learn the local language. This is not only a sign of respect: it will allow you to become more familiar with the culture and build up a rapport with Arabic-speaking people. So if you’re planning to teach English or even start up your own language school out in Egypt, prepare by studying for TEFL qualification in Egypt and learning some Arabic to help your venture run smoothly. Also set up a bank account to help manage your business’s finances more comfortably.

Teach English in Ghana

	Looking for a rewarding experience? Apply to work as a teacher in Ghana!


	 

	Guide to Teaching in Ghana

	Help teachers in Ghana provide desperately needed education to school children and youngsters. There are lots of wonderful rewarding teaching projects in places like the northern townships of Accra. The children who attend the school are between the ages of 3 to 12. They learn topics such as math, science, French, and moral education. Many children from this area come from low-income families and are obligated to leave school to work in order to help support their families. The teachers and staff recognize this and try to provide a high quality education to every child who steps through the gates of the school in hopes of seeing them through elemetary school. They have limited resources to work with, but they use their creativity to make learning enjoyable for everyone. Volunteers can help with this meaningful objective. 

	On these placements you will have a supporting role as teacher&#39;s assistant. There will be lots of different material covered in class, so you can help to mentor the children and give them some extra one-on-one attention where necessary. At lunch hour, help serve lunch and play with the children in the courtyard. Your help will go a long way just by showing your support to the teachers, or by helping to prepare classroom materials. It is certain that the children will be just as excited about you being there as you will be! There are no particular skills required to volunteer on this project except for a love of children! This also means you should be patient, flexible and ready to help out wherever you are needed. If you have teaching experience, the staff at the school will help you determine where your skills can be the most helpful. 

	School and projects are closed for two weeks during Christmas and New Years, from mid-April until mid-May, and for summer holidays from July 26 to September 9.

	 

	 

	Ghana Teaching Experiences & TEFL Reviews

	Tom Kent from the UK participated on a teaching placement in Ghana and this is how he got on: "When we arrived we were greeted by a sea of smiling and laughing ten year old faces, and immediately invited to join the huge chaotic game of football going on. A friendly teacher called Kwame allocated us teams, and a riotous game commenced. Countless fouls later and after everyone was well and truly shattered, a sweaty group of white English boys accompanied the crowd of panting children into the canteen. Jolly canteen staff asked us how our game had been and teased everyone about how dusty we all were. As we sat stuffing our faces, amid a horde of giggling children, Ghanaians had proved to be a very welcoming bunch and the experience turned out to be amazing which will live with me forever."

	Best Time to Get a Teaching Job

	There is a high demand for English teachers in Guatemala all year round and no best time to apply.

	 

	 

	

	Where to Find Teaching Work

	Very few jobs are advertised on the internet and most are found locally either by going into to language schools or in local newspapers. Most people find teaching vacancies at private language schools where there are more jobs and the wages tend to be higher. Some language schools can also help you other insentives like discounted accommodation but sometimes working hours can be long. Some charities and non-profit organisations recruit English teachers to help improve education among local communities. Sometimes a small stipend salary is offered. You can also give private lessons to supplement your income, you are best advertising your services locally on messageboards and in-person. 

	 

	 

	Visa

	You can enter Guatemala on a tourist visa which is valid for 90 days and then teach English which is what most people do. Language schools can get around the red tape of people not having a work visa by offering teachers a ‘living allowance’ rather than a salary, you can expect to be paid cash in hand. If you would like to stay longer than 3 months you can extentd your visa or cross into a neighbouring country and back again.

	 

	 

	Requirements and Elibility

	Guatemala doesn&#39;t generally have strict criteria for teaching English, lots of language schools hire teachers without a degree or any official TEFL certififcation. If you are wondering if you can teach in Guatemala without a degree then yes you can. We recommend taking a TEFL course though as this will help prepare you for teaching in Guatmeala.

	 

	 

	Salary for Teaching in Guatemala

	Guatemala isn&#39;t the country to teach if you want to get rich, wages here are very low compared to other worldwide TEFL destinations. Please note Guatemala is a developing country, there are a selection of paid teaching jobs in Guatemala but a lot are un-paid. You should be able to get by even with the low wages as the cost of living is also very low. If you are looking to gain experience you might want to check out our volunteer programs in Guatemala.

	 

	 

	Cost of Living

	Guatemala is a great value destination, accommodation, hotels, hostels, food and transport are cheap compared to other country in this region. To save money we recommend eating local food, either buying at markets or locally run cafes and restraurants and avoid Western companies where prices are higher.

	 

	 

	Health & Safety

	Guatemala had a brutal civil war a few decades ago but now this country is very safe and developing at an fast pace. You shouldn&#39;t encounter any issues when teaching here.

	 

	

	What to Do in Your Spare Time

	Guatemala shares borders with Mexico, Belize, Honduras and El Salvador and there will be lots of opportunities for you to explore in your spare time. Guatemala is a country steeped in tradition, there are ancient ruins from the Maya civilisation which are still scattered around the country.

Teach English in Guyana

	Guyana is probably a country you haven&#39;t considered when thinking about going to teach English overseas. Guyana is situated in North Eastern South America and is an exotic country relatively undiscovered. There is a real need for native English speaking teachers and very little competition for jobs with both paid and voluntary positions available.


	 

	Guide to Teaching Abroad in Guyana

	Guyana has a tropical climate and some beautiful beaches, scenery and friendly and welcoming people. This is a vibrant country to work as an English teacher, as local people speak English there is a smaller need for TEFL teachers although there are jobs available and less teachers head here to work meaning the better the chances of getting employment. 

	This might suprise you but English is the official language of Guyana but they converse in a slightly different dialect known as Creole. Guyana used to be part of the British colony and now people speak a mixture of English with a combination of Caribbean. Teaching in Guyana can be an eye opening experience, facilities can be basic and living conditions basic to what you might be used to. This will be the challenge of your life.

	Visa

	To work in Guyana you will need to apply for a working visa, this will need to be arranged by your employer and costs around £100 (US$140).

	 

	 

	Requirements for Teaching in Guyana

	Most employers will require you to be a native English speaker, with previous experience and a bachelor’s degree. A TEFL certificate is not a necessity but it will improve your chances of finding work.

	 

	 

	Top Tips to Get a Job Teaching in Guyana

	Very few positions are advertised online and so we recommend going to language schools once in the country. It is better to meet and talk to hiring managers face to face although you could also e-mail or phone them in advance.

Teach English in Myanmar

	There is a growing demand for English teachers in Myanmar (Burma), this country is making huge strides forward and local people are now keen to learn or improve their English skills. Although, you won’t be rich teaching in Myanmar, you will get an authentic experience and the cost of living is very low. Teaching in Myanmar will be a life changing experience you will never forget!


	Guide to Teaching in Myanmar

	Myanmar (previously known as Burma) is a country located in Southeast Asia and is one of the more exotic countries for TEFL teachers. Myanmar shares borders with Bangladesh, China, India, Laos and Thailand and you will get lots of time to explore your new surroundings in your spare time. You will get a unique experience and be able to be immersed in the country whilst helping friendly local students.  

	As a teacher in Myanmar you will be able to fill the vital role of sharing knowledge and skills to help young adult students reach their goals related to community development. Teachers are needed for a range of classes, mostly pre-Intermediate English classes focused on academic, listening and speaking classes. Other classes include Social Sciences, Environmental studies, and workshops in areas including art, dance, public speaking, research, grant writing, etc. Teachers are encouraged to share their interests and talents with prior approval.

	Teachers generally spend 3 hours/ day up to 20 hours/ week in the classrooms. You will be able to consult with the program staff in Yangon about logistical, social or academic issues that may arise. In addition to teaching and logistical support, volunteers receive some financial support to offset their expenses during their placement and support arranging an appropriate visa. Working as a teacher in Burma requires pragmatism, patience, independence, initiative and a genuine respect for the host people and their culture.

	 

	Top Reasons to Teach in Myanmar

	
		
			The locals are some of the friendliest in the world
		
			This country is a lot less touristy than Thailand
		
			Low rent and food costs mean you can easily save money
		
			Teachers are very respected
		
			See spectacular places in your spare time
		
			The country is free from Western commercialism - get here before the big companies arrive
	


	 

	Best Time to Seek Employment

	There is no best time to teach in Myanmar.

	 

	Top Tips for Teaching in Myanmar

	There are lots of different languages spoken with Myanmar being the official, you might want to learn to words and phrases which will help make the experience more enjoyable. Some local people also already speak English, this is due to the colonial days of Burma when it was under British rule. You might want to consider taking an online TEFL course in Myanmar or search TEFL certifications in Asia. We also recommend avoiding talking about politics with local people.

	 

	Why the Need for English Teachers

	Myanmar is welcoming a new age of democracy and has opened its doors to international visitors and tourist is growing rapidily which in turn is bringing in investment and boosting the local economy. Tourism is going to be one of the biggest employers in the country and so people both young and old are keen to get to grips with the English language which will provide them with a better career and more money.

	 

	Best Places to Seek TEFL Employment in Myanmar

	Most English teaching jobs are available in the larger cities like Yangon (Rangoon) and Mandalay. There are opportunities to teach in more rural locations but jobs are limited.

	 

	How to Get a Teaching Job in Myanmar

	It is difficult to find teaching jobs in advance, most positions are not advertised on the internet. There are an increasing amount of private language schools and international schools opening up in Myanmar and our best recommendation is to seek out jobs locally whilst in Myanmar by going door to door to language schools. Local newspapers and jobs boards usually have postings for TEFL jobs which can be a good way to find vacancies. You will usually need to have an interview in person and the process is usually very quick compared to some countries which are made more difficult with red tape.

	 

	Salary 

	Wages for teaching in Myanmar are low compared to teaching in Asia and countries nearby. A lot of positions are unpaid which is perfect if you would like to give back, help local people and make a difference through volunteering in Myanmar. If you have experience, a degree and a certification you are likely to be paid more.

	 

	Visa

	Most people enter Myanmar on a tourist visa and then either work cash in hand or after you have got a job, you can apply for a Myanmar business visa. You will need an invitation or recommendation from a language school to obtain a business visa.

	 

	Eligibility, Requirements & Qualifications

	Every school has different eligibility criteria, some require minimum qualifications or just enthauaism whilst others will required certifications like a TESOL, CELTA or TEFL course, a BA degree and previosu teaching experience.

	Ideal candidates:

	
		Speak English with native-fluency
	
		Can commit for 10 weeks – 12 months, with some exceptions
	
		Are flexible and hard working people with experience living in developing counties
	
		Have teaching experience or strong academic backgrounds
	
		Are aware and culturally sensitive to Myanmar’s traditions and ways of life


	 

	Health & Safety

	Despite what you might think, Myanmar is a very safe country to teach in. The military rule is over and although this country isn&#39;t as developed as other nations, it is not as basic as you might think. If you do encounter any problems healthwise though we recommend crossing the border into Thailand to seek medical attention.

Teach English in the Middle East
Take a TEFL course and teach in the Middle East. Schools in Egypt, Jordan, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and other Middle Eastern nations all seek certified English teachers. In many Arab nations, university classes are taught in English and the region’s location at the crossroads of East and West has made cities like Dubai major hubs of commerce and leisure where English is the norm. In wealthy Gulf States in particular, most positions are offered to experienced teachers with bachelors’ or masters’ degrees in education, in addition to a TEFL / TESOL certification.
Those who qualify for such positions will enjoy some of the highest salaries in the field as pay can range from $ 2,500 - $ 6,000 a month, plus free housing and flights to and from the teacher’s home country. Jobs are somewhat easier to come by for those with just a four-year degree (or even less) and a TEFL/TESOL Certification in Egypt, Morocco, Jordan, and Turkey, where the pay is considerably lower, but the cost of living is low and the opportunities for immersion in one the world’s great regions for culture and history are innumerable.

Some points about teaching in the Middle East:

 * The vast majority of positions in the Gulf Countries (Saudi Arabia, UAE, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, and Oman) are obtained through interviews in advance.
 * Teachers should expect to adhere to local cultural norms, which can vary dramatically from what you may be used to in the West. Within the region, restrictions on personal freedoms like style of dress and the right to consume alcohol can vary widely from country to country, or even from region to region within a particular country.
 * The presence of large expatriate communities, where teachers can socialize with other westerners makes the transition for newcomers to the region much easier.

There are lots of TEFL jobs in Vietnam for English speakers, both international and local companies recruit foreign staff all year round to work in schools, universities and language centers. 


	Guide to Teaching English in Vietnam

	

	Vietnam is an up and coming destination which has culture, history, tradition and welcoming people. It is also much cheaper to live in compared to teaching in Thailand or other countries in Asia for example which makes it easier to save money.

	Vietnam is on the rise after decades of war and poverty, with Vietnam boasting a safe place to live with one of the fastest growing economies in the World, according to the World Economic Forum. Vietnam continually attracts a flow of foreign teachers although Laos has been hailed by commentators as one the planet&#39;s emerging destinations for those looking to searching for a more exotic teaching abroad destination. If you are not yet qualified view our TEFL certification courses in Vietnam.

	Don&#39;t let Vietnam&#39;s brutal past put you off teaching here, this country is very safe. This country has a booming TEFL market, there are jobs available for beginners who are newy qualified and for more experienced teachers. Its easier to find work in the main cities where there are more schools and language centres. There is a big market for foreigner workers from affluent Vietnamese people who are seeking private lessons. Local people are increasingly keen to learn English to enhance their employment opportunities in different industries like the booming oil and tourism industry. Applying for private TEFL jobs can be quite lucrative and a better bet for making money than in public schools. 

	Each new day teaching in Vietnam is an exciting adventure where you will be thrilled, challenged, delighted and exhausted all at once. There are so many places you can find work, from large cities like Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon) to small coastal towns like Hue and Nha Trang. View our guide to teaching in Vietnam and apply today.

	 

	Best Places to Work as a Teacher in Vietnam

	Depending on your job you can have a much different experience, for example the cities can be really fun but if you are looking for a more relaxing stay head to the coast or smaller towns away from Saigon and Hanoi. Noise and pollution can be a problem and also rents are much higher in these two cities but this is also where most jobs can be found. Below we have put together a run down of the most popular locations, please research all destinations before applying:

	Hanoi

	Hanoi is one of the most popular places to teach English, located in the North of the country this is a fascinating city to be based. This is the capital city of Vietnam and during your stay here you will need to visit the Old Quarter. Here you will find a maze of streets each specializing in particular trades such as silk, jewellery, etc. Stroll around the nearby Hoan Kiem Lake and see if you can spot 100-year-old turtles that still inhabit the waters, or strike a bargain at the night market in the heart of the district. Visit the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum; located in the centre of Ba Dinh Square, where the beloved Vietnamese leader Ho Chi Minh established the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and ultimately, where his body is kept for people to pay their respects.

	If you have the time, be sure to explore the excellent Tran Quoc Pagoda or the Temple of Literature (Van Mieu). In the evening, you will have the option of sampling some of the local food, with the Old Quarter being a popular spot to taste the local cuisine and enjoy a drink. There are also several not-for-profit restaurants, that gives street children the opportunity for vocational training and greatly changes many lives. Also one of the benefits of teaching in Hanoi is the close proximity to Ha Long Bay and Sapa - two spectacular relaxing destinations which offer a peaceful break from the frantic city life. During a short break to Ha Long Bay you will leave behind the hustle and bustle of city life and experience a relaxing cruise on a local &#39;junk&#39; boat - a must for any TEFL teacher based in Northern Vietnam.

	Ho Chi Minh City

	Most TEFL jobs in Vietnam are located in the Southern city of Ho Chi Minh, you might also know it by the previous name - Saigon.

	Hoi An

	Hoi An is a charming place to teach English and without a doubt beautifully preserved and vibrant in the evening. You will get to stroll through the picturesque streets of the old town, and marvel at the splendid colours and designs of so many lanterns. Whet your appetite with a fun local cookery class in the town that&#39;s fast becoming famous for superb food and local delicacies Rent a bike and cycle to one of Hoi An’s easily accessible and peaceful beaches. In your spare time you could visit the Japanese covered bridge, the Quan Cong Temple or the museum of History and Culture. It&#39;s paradise for shoppers in Hoi An - Tailors are on hand to produce almost any item of clothing your heart desires at very reasonable prices and it&#39;s a haven for arts & crafts including beautiful lanterns. Studded with lots of great bars and restaurants and you will quickly realise that Hoi An is a gem in the Vietnamese crown and you won’t want to leave!!

	Hue

	Just North of Hoi An is the imperial city of Hue. This is a more off the beaten track destination to get a teaching job. You&#39;ll have ample time to explore the historic monuments of Hue, including the former Royal Citadel – a forbidden city that was built for the Nguyen emperors. In your free time you might want to take a boat trip on the Perfume River offers a different perspective of the city or, if you are feeling more energetic, why not take a guided motorbike tour of the countryside whilst taking in some of the best sights that Hue and its surroundings has to offer. 

	 

	What to Expect 

	

	When you first arrive in Vietnam all your senses will be stimulated by the sights, smells, sounds and textures of this country. Expect students to be very friendly wanting to take you out and show you around, English teachers are held in high regard here. When working as a TEFL teacher in Vietnam you will mostly be used Monday to Friday around 5 hours per day, working at a school can be a physically exhausting day when you first start, but you soon get into the routine of early starts. If you are freelance or leading private lessons this will be different.

	 

	Salary for Teaching in Vietnam

	Vietnam can be a good choice if you are looking for your first TEFL job, you can expect wages of around $15 per hour. This really depends on your employer and also if you give private lessons.

	 

	Requirements

	
		
	
		You will need a degree to teach in Vietnam which is still a one-party socialist country. Please note Vietnam institutions are also becoming quite picky when it comes to foreign teachers and so a lot now require higher qualifications like Celta and previous experience.
	
		 
	
		Things to Do in Your Spare Time
	
		This country is an amazing destination to work as a teacher, you will also get lots of free time to explore your surroundings. You could:

	Zanzibar Teaching Testimonials & TEFL Reviews

	"I worked in Zanzibar and found the experience immensely rewarding! The founders of the school truly have the students&#39; best interests at heart. Teachers from the island of Zanzibar, the mainland, and the international community collaborate in order to provide students with the most challenging and creative educations possible. BSZ, in particular, allows for Zanzibari children to attend who may not otherwise be able to enroll in private schooling. As a teacher, I found myself invested not only in my school community but in the surrounding school neighborhoods as well.

	As an American far from fluent in the Swahili language, I found much comfort in the support and aid of my coworkers and employers during my stay on the island. All levels of staff and faculty pooled their resources in order to locate and acquire the most appropriate teaching and learning materials. Looking back on my time at BSZ, I recognize just how deeply the experience touched my life and shaped my future aspirations. I appreciate the opportunity to recommend this organization on behalf of my friends and family at BSZ." - Rachel Elbin taught English with the British School of Zanzibar

	"The children of the school were also wonderful and I loved spending time with them, and one of the reasons I intend to go back to Uganda is to visit them. I think all of the volunteers had a great time, both during the day and the night. The nightlife was wonderful, dancing to the beat of the African drums around a campfire and going to the town to have drinks and chat with the locals. I am so glad that I took part in the volunteer program and I am very sad to have had to leave. It was an experience that has given me many happy memories and it is one which I can’t wait to repeat". - Sam, UK

Teach in Zambia

	If you would like to help shape the future of Zambia you might want to become a teacher or educational and recreation assistant. 


	

	Teach in Zambia

	Children under the age of 8 are not required to attend any formal schooling and when over that age a lot do not attend due to family commitments or choosing to start a job. This means a lot of children are put at a disadvantage for future life even before it has started but there are lots of charities working to help. By choosing to join educational projects you will get to make a difference to children lives and also maybe learn a lot yourself too, placements in Zambia can be challenging due to the basic nature of classrooms especially in rural areas.

	Shockingly 20% of Zambian primary students are in community schools and the vast majority cannot read a single word by the end of Grade 2. Charities and NGO&#39;s operate projects providing equipment and literature to schools helping students progress and learn. The books incorporate full-colour photographs with simple rhymes in English, Bemba, Tonga and Nyanja and give Zambian children a rare opportunity to learn using books which reflect their own experiences of day-to-day life.

	Organisations like &#39;Teachers in Action&#39; were funded directly to produce and distribute books to early readers in community schools for young pupils who desperately need resources. You can also donate to help too, proceeds go to support worthwhile causes like the Ranchhod Hospice Daycare and Preschool and the Sables Street Kids program, both in Kabwe, Zambia. Apply to make a difference and help education efforts today.

	Things to think about when thinking about teaching in the UK

	Accommodation usually isn&#39;t included in a lot of job packages unless you are teaching at a summer school. Sometimes if you live outside of the EU it can be difficult to gain a work visa.

Ten of the best lads weekend destinations

	As a young man with a little cash and a lot of travel options, the world is your oyster – but what are the best ideas for an evening or two of fun and frivolity? You’ll want a destination, either in the UK or abroad, with drinks, good restaurants, and perhaps a night at the tables like those you’d find replicated at places like SuperCasino. Here are ten top European lads destinations for a night of mayhem.


	 

	 

	1) Riga

	The young upstart challenging Tallinn in the Baltic lads’ night league table, Riga Town Hall Square has that fascinating and fabulous architecture as a backdrop before a mazy dribble through a stunningly colourful collection of buildings in the old city. And it’s not too expensive.

	 

	 

	2) Belfast

	Everyone knows about Dublin, but what about its counterpart across the border?

	Anywhere that has a ‘Filthy Quarter’ has got to be worth a peek, especially at a venue that has its own Oktoberfest, ‘Gypsy Lounge’ and Secret Garden. There’s also some brilliant history for the morning after, including the museum of Titanic Belfast.

	 

	 

	3) London

	Where to start? Rather than trying to cover the whole city you could pick a certain area, such as Camden, Clapham, Soho or Notting Hill. Covent Garden alone will provide everything you need for a night of chaos. You could do worse than checking out TwentySomethingLondon to plan your eating and drinking around the city’s attractions.

	 

	 

	4) Krakow

	Poland has several great venues only a short flight away – Warsaw and Wroclaw are also superb – but Medieval Krakow seems to be the number one travel destination. Simple maths: Bars which scream rustic and shabby chic such as Alchemia and Singer Café, plus Eastern European beers of brutal strength, equals fun.

	 

	 

	5) Newcastle

	View the iconic bridges as you take a rampage along the Quayside to visit bars such as the Pitcher and Piano, before heading inland for the mixologists’ dreams that is Pleased to Meet You, the chic style of Livello, and the North East Bar of the Year Winner 2013 No.28. 

	 

	 

	6) Budapest

	Taking a dip in The Gellert Spa is equivalent to ‘taking a bath in a Cathedral’, so the saying goes – and it might also be the perfect place to sweat out a hangover. The Hungarian capital is actually two cities in one (Bude and Pest) with a different vibe - whatever you do check out the Ruin pubs, which are among the finest in the world. 

	 

	 

	7) Sheffield

	This vibrant university town is bursting with excellent bars and venues for a raucous night. Live music fans will be well aware of the O2 Academy, and most might know of the Leadmill, but it would be remiss to visit the Steel City without a slow jaunt along the host of quality bars and pubs on the parallel roads of West Street and Division street.

	 

	 

	8) Seville

	An alternative to Barcelona and Madrid, the city promises a great night of discotecas, Tapas, Flamenco, and the devastating Agua de Sevilla – a killer cocktail of four types of liquor, champagne, pineapple juice and cream. Plus you might be able to go along to a Sevilla or Real Betis match if you arrive an hour before kick-off.

	 

	9) Prague

	A tried and tested venue for lads looking for a weekend of fun, Prague is a fascinating smorgasbord of castles and royalty, neo-renaissance museums, strip joints, and hipster multicultural bars and pubs such as the Crossclub and its musical dramaturgy.

	 

	 

	10) Newquay

	Voted “one of the nation’s favourite seaside towns”, Newquay and its beaches represent a great lads’ night out on a super summer evening. Combine surfing, kayaking and other water sports with a host of bars such as the Sailors Arms and Chy Bar.

The 10 Best Things to Do in Brighton, England

	Brighton isn’t a city – it’s an experience. The UK’s most popular seaside resort has a way of capturing people’s hearts and minds, making one‑time visitors into serial Brighton addicts.


	There are a whole range of delights here, from top‑class restaurants to trendy shopping streets, and genteel Victorian architecture to beach‑side beer gardens. But what really sets this place apart is its unique atmosphere.

	Whether it’s discovering a colourful piece of street art, tasting food you’ve never heard of before, or seeing buskers dancing and singing joyfully with tourists, this city will linger with you long after you’ve left.

	So here goes – here are 10 of the absolute best things you can see and do when visiting Brighton.

	 

	1) Visit the Royal Pavilion

	No, it’s not the Taj Mahal. The Royal Pavilion may look like an exotic Indian palace on the outside, but it actually started life as a seaside getaway from British royalty.  

	This impressive palace was created for King George IV, as a luxury retreat where he could indulge his extravagant lifestyle.

	It was built at the height of the British Empire, and furnished with an eclectic mix of Indian and Chinese styles. I’d especially recommend a visit to the Music Room, where lotus­‑shaped chandeliers hang from the ceiling, and painted dragons crawl from floor to ceiling.

	 

	2) Explore Brighton’s independent shops

	Brighton has two main shopping quarters, the Lanes and the North Laine – each with their own special attractions.

	The Lanes is home to many winding alleys, crammed full of little independent boutiques and heavenly cake shops. It’s a fun place to explore, but beware: the narrow old streets here can get crowded, especially in the summer months!

	If you’re after a bargain, or simply a good time, you should also check out the North Laine. There’s a decidedly quirky vibe to this area, and you can find everything here from vintage clothes, to comic books, to ‘vegetarian shoes’ and healing crystals.

	The North Laine might not be as upmarket as the neighbouring Lanes, but it’s as ‘Brighton’ as it gets.

	 

	3) Stay out all night

	Ever since King George IV decided to build his pleasure palace here, Brighton has had – let’s say – a bit of a reputation.

	Nowadays, if you want to let loose and dance the night away, you’ll find a bewildering array of pubs, bars and nightclubs across the city.  

	Many of Brighton’s pubs seem to have been designed exclusively for hipsters, with lots of neon lighting and expensive craft beer. But there are still many hidden gems here, including a pub that has been sculpted to look like a seaside cave, and a bar offering more than 100 types of gin.

	The nightclubs here are also well worth a visit. Brighton’s seaside establishments are adept at pulling down big names from London – and with a big student population to cater to, you’ll find somewhere open late on every night of the week.

	 

	4) Take a seaside stroll

	If you’ve indulged yourself a little too much, there’s nothing better to clear your head than a stroll by the seaside.

	Turn right from the pier towards Hove, and you’ll come across pleasant seafront art galleries, fairground rides and the wonderful Brighton Music Hall, where you can have a beer in the sun while listening to live music.

	Further on, you’ll come to Brighton’s grand Regency squares: first Brunswick, then Palmeira. These rows of tall, cream‑coloured town houses are seriously beautiful, and well‑worth taking the time to see.

	Head in the other direction from the pier, towards Kemptown, to check out the elegant and derelict Madeira Terrace walkway. Eventually you’ll come to Brighton Marina, a great place to stop for a drink or snack by the waterside.

	 

	5) See Brighton from above

	Of course, if you really want to see Brighton in all its glory, the best way to do this is by soaring into the sky on the newly‑built British Airways i360.

	The i360, recognised as the world’s tallest moving observation tower, takes visitors from ground level up to a lofty 138 metres above the city in a glass viewing pod.

	From here, you can marvel at the whole of Brighton and Hove, stretched out beneath you. On a clear day, you’ll also be treated to great views of the English Channel, and the serene white cliffs of the Seven Sisters in the far distance.

	 

	6) Ride on the world’s oldest electric railway

	For those who are afraid of heights, you could always take in the sea air while riding on the world’s oldest electric railway.

	Volk’s Railway was designed by the young entrepreneur Magnus Volk in 1883, and is a splendid piece of Victorian engineering. Riding in one of its handsome and old‑fashioned carriages is the perfect way to connect with Brighton’s past.

	The railway line runs from the Brighton Aquarium all the way to the Marina, and is usually open from around Easter time until the end of October.

	 

	7) Laugh your socks off at a comedy club

	Comedy is a part of Brighton’s identity, just like the famous Pier or a stick of Brighton rock.

	Head to the Komedia club, to see famous names that will have you rolling in the aisles. Or attend one of the city’s open mic nights, where amateur comics battle it out to tickle your funny bone.

	Either way, Brighton’s comedy shows will definitely leave you with a smile on your face!

	 

	8) Go vegetarian for the day

	If there’s anywhere that can convince you to go meat‑free, it’s Brighton.

	You’ll find vegetarian restaurants of all shapes and sizes here, ranging from fine dining establishments to bustling cafes. What’s more, the chefs here are constantly coming up with new ways to get you to eat your greens.

	There’s vegan pizza, vegan tapas – and for those who want to enjoy the full seaside experience, you can even try a plant‑based version of fish n’ chips!

	 

	9) Wander down London Road 

	London Road used one of the city’s most run‑down neighbourhoods, but recent years have seen a transformation take place.

	New shops and restaurants have sprung up, bringing life and colour to this inner‑city district. The newly‑built Open Market hosts a thriving community of traders, as well as a number of artists’ studios.

	The area also boasts some of the city’s best pubs – including the World’s End with its retro gaming arcade, and the Hobgoblin, home to one of Brighton’s biggest and best beer gardens.

	 

	10) Join in the fun at one of Brighton’s many festivals

	Brighton’s calendar is packed full of annual festivals that bring joy and colour to the city.

	The best time to visit is in May during Brighton Festival, the UK’s second largest arts festival after Edinburgh.

	Also happening in May are the Brighton Fringe festival, the Great Escape music festival, and the Artist’s Open Houses events – weekends where hundreds of artists across Brighton open their houses and studios to curious visitors.

	Finally, visit later in the summer for Brighton’s world‑famous gay pride celebration. This colourful, vibrant event is enjoyed by residents and visitors of all persuasions, and soaking up the atmosphere here will definitely restore your faith in humanity.

	 

	So, there you have it – 10 of the best things you can do on a visit to Brighton. From shopping to festival‑going, pub­‑hopping to fine dining, culture to comedy, this really is one of the best destinations in the UK to have a good time.

	But don’t take my word for it. Visit Brighton for yourself, and find out why so many people are in love with this city by the sea.

The Best Surf Spots to Visit Down Under

	If you’re looking to catch a few waves in Australia this summer, your choices are virtually endless. With a string of islands down the east of the country all offering incredible beaches, not to mention the island of Tasmania at the foot of the country, Australia is well known for having some of the most incredible beaches in the world. The problem is that you’re now spoiled for choice – if you haven’t been to Australia yet to try these beaches for yourself, how do you know where to start? Fortunately we’re here to help you get your bearings on the best beaches in Australia. Go you’re your wetsuit and get your board waxed – here are the best surf spots to visit down under.


	 

	Marrawah, Tasmania

	If you’re looking to get a load of surfing in and not a lot else, Marrawah in Tasmania may just be the choice for you. There are some great waves to be had, but because it’s just home to one little fishing town in the middle of nowhere, you can avoid the touristy crowds that you’d get at some of Australia’s other surf beaches.

	 

	Catherine Hill Bay, New South Wales

	Moving northeast to the Sydney area, Catherine Hill Bay is slightly more touristy, but not to the level of Sydney proper. Catherine Hill Bay is home to a little mining village and some impressive barrels you can ride just off the coast. 

	 

	Agnes Waters, Queensland

	Despite Agnes Waters being routinely listed as one of Australia’s top 10 beaches, this Queensland beach still isn’t massively touristy. It is, however, the last surfing beach you can visit in the north of the country before you hit the Great Barrier Reef. If you’re keen on stopping by Agnes Beach and catching a few waves, grab yourself a tent and some friends and head on down. If your friends can’t surf yet, drop them off at the local surf school before going and pulling your wetsuit on.

	https://www.wetsuitcentre.co.uk/wetsuits.html

	 

	Bells Beach, Victoria

	We’re now at the one of the most popular surf beaches in Australia, Bells Beach. This beach in Victoria is actually home to the Australia’s oldest professional surf competition, the Rip Curl Pro. If you aren’t already an advanced surfer, this beach may be a little harsh – the waves here can reach as high as 5m on a fairly regular basis. If you’re not ready to try the waves for yourself just yet, there’s always a wave of surfers on the water that you can test your photography skills on.

	 

	Margaret River, Western Australia

	Margaret River is possibly one of the most advanced surf beaches in the world, let alone Australia. This beach is simply a clump of billion-year-old limestone which juts out into the raw ocean, with a string of extremely fine soft white sand to walk along when you’re not in the water. With regular 6m waves forming the perfect barrels to ride though, it’s quite surprising if you make your way here and don’t get in the water. On that note, it’s little surprise that this beach is so popular with some of the world’s greatest professional surfers. If Bells Beach was too advanced for you though, Margaret River is certainly not going to encourage you to get out on the water. These waves are perfect for the highly advanced rider, but they’re not for the faint of heart!

The Best Tourist Sites to Visit in Oslo 

	Norway’s capital, Oslo, is a city unlike any other; a cosmopolitan hub buzzing with energy which still manages to stay close to nature. With plenty of museums, stunning architecture, cutting-edge food, and an established fashion and art scene, it should definitely be on your travel bucket list. 


	Oslo’s compact city centre makes it ideal for exploring by bike or on foot, and its efficient public transport system means you’ll have no problem getting to all the best sites.

	Here are the best places you should add to your Oslo travel itinerary:

	 

	1. Vigeland Sculpture Park (Vigelandsparken)

	

	Situated within Frogner Park, this sculpture park is the largest in the world made by a single artist. With more than 200 sculptures by Gustav Vigeland in bronze, cast iron, and granite, the collection is undoubtedly impressive. 

	Although the type of statues on display vary greatly, they are all naked. Vigeland wished to emphasize that they could “be anyone, anywhere, at any time”, and felt no desire to define traits such as religion or nationality. On a nice day, this becomes the go-to picnic spot for locals and tourists alike. 

	 

	2. Holmenkollen Ski Museum & Ski Jump

	

	The Holmenkollen neighbourhood is located on a hill on the Northwestern side of the city at 375 metres above sea level. It’s easily accessed by subway and offers excellent views over Oslo. 

	The Ski Museum is underneath the famous ski jump and presents over 4.000 years of skiing history. It also showcases an extensive collection of Norwegian polar exploration artefacts, as well as a modern skiing and snowboarding exhibition. 

	Head to the observation deck on top of the jump for panoramic views over the city, which are particularly spectacular at night. 

	 

	3. National Opera House (Operahuset)

	

	Just 500 metres from the central station (Oslo S), this architectural masterpiece is considered to be the pride of the city. Sitting at the water’s edge in the harbour, it has an angled, white exterior with large-scale windows which allow a glimpse inside. In fact, it looks like the building is mysteriously rising up from the water. 

	There is a restaurant in the lobby and visitors are encouraged to take a stroll on the roof, which offers great views over the city as well as the Oslo fjord. 

	 

	3. The Viking Ship Museum (Vikingskipshuset)

	For a true Viking Age experience, head to the Viking Ship Museum on the Bygdøy peninsula. It’s home to the world’s best preserved Viking ships and showcases artefacts found in Viking tombs around the Oslo fjord.

	You can also explore discoveries from the Gokstad, Oseberg, and Tune ships, as well as a variety of items such as small boats, tools, and eating utensils. As a bonus, you can use your ticket to enter the Historical Museum for free within 24 hours of your visit.  

	 

	4. Akershus Fortress (Akershus Festning)

	

	Rising above the city on a hill, visit the Akershus Fortress and Castle to discover some of Oslo’s rich history and enjoy a nice walk with great views. Guided tours are available during the summer. 

	Its history dates back to 1299 and was commenced under King Håkon V. It was modernised in the 17th century under the rule of King Christian IV and turned into a Renaissance palace, but the front still remains medieval. 

	 

	5. Norsk Folkemuseum 

	Vsit one of the world’s oldest and largest open-air museums to experience Norway’s rich cultural history. Also on the Bygdøy peninsula, the Norsk Folkemuseum features real-sized historical buildings which represent the different regions of the country. 

	Staff are dressed in traditional clothes from various time periods and demonstrate activities such as brewing beer and baking lefse with plenty of storytelling. It’s one of the best places to see a traditional Stavkirke, a medieval wooden Christian church dating back to the year 1200. 

	There are also indoor exhibitions featuring traditional handicraft items, folk costumes, and pharmaceutical history. In the summer, they offer extra activities such as feeding animals and horse and carriage rides.   

	 

	6. National Gallery (Nasjonalmuseet)

	Established in 1837, Oslo’s National Museum houses the largest collection of paintings, drawings, and sculptures in Norway. Its permanent collection features some of Edvard Munch’s most famous paintings, including “Scream”, and they also have impressive temporary collections. 

	As well as national artists, you can take in pieces by famous European artists such as Gauguin, Picasso, and Manet. For an enchanting experience, head to the Fairy Tale Room which features art depicting princesses, trolls, and other magical creatures. 

	 

	7. TusenFryd Amusement Park

	The park is open from mid April through to September and located 30 minutes south of Oslo, so if you fancy doing something different, hop on a bus and spend the day having fun. 

	TusenFryd is Norway’s largest amusement park, and with over 30 attractions which cater to all ages, there’s something for everyone. Entrance also includes access to a small water park.

The Ultimate Australia Packing List


	 

	 

	Australia is known for its vast and wild adventure that draws people from as far as North America, Europe and other parts of the world. As a rule, whenever one is traveling abroad, there are dos and don’ts one should familiarize with to avoid unnecessary disappointments. Knowing to speak what is the most spoken language in the world is good but learning local dialects and slang words is more substantial as it can ease your stay abroad. When packing your stuff, some things are a must-have in your bag to enhance your adventure. For this reason, this article will delve into some essentials one should carry when going on a trip to Australia.

	 

	
		Carry enough drinks 


	If you love liquors, it is a good thing to stock enough of them in your backpack as it is costly to buy drinks in bars. If you are on a shoestring budget, you can drink some for topping up in a bar. Alternatively, make a budgetary provision of the same to avoid spending money that is meant for other things.

	
		Don’t forget to include a dictionary – Australian into American


	You must be wondering why carrying an Australian dictionary when visiting this country is recommended. The main reason is that even though English is the official language, there are local dialects that may make communication difficult.

	 

	Having this dictionary will come in handy as some common words may mean different things in Australia. For instance, “bum bag” is how they call a fanny pack, “capsicums” means peppers, “ketchup” stands for tomato sauce, “chips” for fries, “car boot” means trunk, “car bonnet” – a hood, say “fortnight” to indicate period after two weeks, and say “gas” if you need some petrol.

	 

	Nothing can be as disappointing as referring to something you know too well only for your friends to look surprised. In Australia for example, rooting which is cheering or supporting a side there means having sex and the city center means central business district (CBD) Some shortened words may also be confusing and mean something else i.e., “bickies” stands for biscuits, and arvo, which is a short name for afternoon, may be confused with avocado. You may not see much sense in what I am saying now, but when you arrive there, you will see the confusion some of these words can cause.

	 

	
		Carry sun-blocks and hydro flasks


	 

	If you haven’t been in this country before, then carry sun-blocks to protect your skin and if possible, try staying balance in the shadows longer. Your eyes too should be well protected with sunglasses and ensure your body is well hydrated as the excessive heat from the sun may cause sunburns if you don’t.

	

	Instead of buying packed water, you can carry a refillable hydro flask which can be refilled with tap water. Not that the sun there is different from the one in other parts of the world, but due to its thinner Ozone layer, it makes surfaces to heat up much easier. In fact, South Eastern Queensland has the highest cancer prevalence in Australia. Consequently, if you have pale skin, ensure it is not exposed to direct sunlight.

	
		Pack a swimsuit and some popcorn to eat as you watch games


	In other parts of the world like Europe, football is glorified, but things are different in Australia as rugby is the most preferred game. And those who don’t like it, opt for other sports such as swimming. During your vacation, you will find several interesting hobbies to engage in as a way of killing time.

	If you are planning your visit during the games season, why not buy some popcorn to enjoy your games as you watch?  Or head to the ocean to have a taste of how swimming is like there but swimmers must be cautious as most waters there are shark invested and to avoid being attacked, you should only swim between flags meant for protecting swimmers from water swells which may bring sharks with them during tides.

	
		Carry your passport as you head to the airport


	Nationals from other parts of the world except New Zealand can only visit Australia if they have a visa.  If you are from Canada, US, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, South Korea and Brunei, you can apply for a Visa online through the official visa application page and then wait for about two days for its approval.

	 

	Approval notifications are made via email address and once approved, only a passport is required at the airport as the systems are computerized, and if you are not from the above countries, liaise with your local embassy to know your country’s visa requirements or instead contract professional custom essay writing service to get a comprehensive information on your nation’s requirements.

	 

	The given Visa is not a permit for searching jobs abroad as visa applicants can only remain there for three months a year, but if you are intending to look for a job, then you should apply for a work permit.

	

	
		A camera to capture beautiful moments


	Camera is one of the most basic things one should carry when going for an adventure. If you don’t have one, you can use your smart phone’s camera but ensure it has a good resolution to take nice shots. When going around, you will see wild animals as there are plenty of them in the parks and you will only have yourself to blame if you fail to capture those beautiful moments for failing to carry one.

	
		Remember to carry an unlocked phone


	There is a poor Internet connection and network coverage in Australia, but you can get free Wi-Fi in major hotels in places like McDonald’s. For this reason, you should invest in a good Wi-Fi router to create the Internet signal for your devices, or you can unlock your phone to accept Tesla SIM card – Tesla has the best network coverage here, but if you don’t do any of those, you will remain offline throughout.

The Ultimate Guide to Planning a School Trip 

	Taking the plunge and organising a school trip can be a very daunting process from start to finish. However, if you do your research and take advice from experts, there is no reason why your next school trip shouldn’t be enjoyable for both you and your pupils. Read on to discover some useful considerations that will make your planning as stress-free and efficient as possible.


	 

	 

	1. Choose Your Destination

	Ensure that you choose a location which provides many activities for your students and enriches them on knowledge to give them the best experience possible.

	 

	 

	2. Contact The Experts

	Of course, you will never be expected to plan a school trip on your own from scratch. There is far too much to consider in terms of location, costs, safety, activities, and so on. The best option to take when planning a school trip is to get in contact with student travel companies who will take a lot of the work off your hands. These companies are specifically designed to offer you a variety of school trip options, taking your needs and preferences into consideration.

	Once you are in touch with a travel company, the next task will be deciding what location to head to. 

	 

	 

	3. Organisation

	To stay organised throughout the whole process, keep timelines and checklists so that you don’t end up forgetting important tasks. A lot goes in to the creating of a school trip and it is essential that the process is as straightforward and controlled as possible. The last thing you want is unhappy students! Note down all important details and keep documents in safe places. Time chunk your tasks and keep a diary of important dates.

	 

	 

	4. Risk Assessments

	As you will be supervising a large amount of students, carrying out risk assessments is a vital part in the planning of a school trip. Ensure that you have covered all risk possibilities in the following areas:

	
		Accommodation
	
		Transport
	
		Excursions


	The concept of a risk assessment is pretty simple. If someone is in danger, then a risk assessment is necessary in order to ensure that unfortunate events are unlikely to take place. The main goal is to ensure that all students (and yourself) get home safe and sound. Be sure to take these factors into heavy consideration:

	
		• Someone identifying a hazard
	
		• Putting judgement on the severity of harm that may be encountered
	
		• Putting in place necessary control measures to rectify the problem


	 

	 

	5. Promote

	Once everything is settled and the trip is in the calendar, you’ll need to promote your trip. This often gets ignored when planning an excursion, but it is very important! Get the buzz going around your students with posters and itineraries.

	 

	 

	6. Enjoy

	Lastly, just make sure that you have a good time! This trip should be just as enjoyable for you as it is for the students!

Thinking about teaching English in Italy?
Advice for Teaching English in Rome, Italy.. Take a course and start a teaching job in Rome....

1. Be prepared to fight for your place in line for gelato: No one can resist the allure of sweet and creamy homemade gelato, and Rome’s is not to be missed. With flavors ranging from the fruity pesca (peach), pera (pear) or fragola (strawberry) to the sweet stracciatella (chocolate chip) and zenzero e cannella (ginger and cinnamon) locals shamelessly crowd their neighborhood 'gelaterie' to get their daily sugar fix. Assert your right for indulging in this delectable dessert, and fight through the mob by repeating scusate (excuse me). You will be asked "Panna?" when your order is being completed - this is the offer of whipped cream on top.
2. Buy wine, not water or soda:  Cheaper than bottled water or a can of cola, it’s often the most economical choice when you’re buying from street vendors. Besides, having a glass of wine or two with lunch is perfectly acceptable in Italy, a country that is home to some of the oldest wine producing regions in the world.
3. There’s a 'prego' for every occasion: This snippet of the Italian vernacular fits a number of contexts at all times of day, meaning everything from ‘how can I help you?’ to ‘you’re welcome.’ A favorite of everyone from pastry store owners to cleaning ladies, it can even be heard as an utterance meaning ‘I pray’- in which case you might catch it walking into a cluttered room or slow-moving pack of tourists.
4. Camp out at Campo de' Fiori: Located in the heart of the city, there is no better market in Rome than the jumble of shops set up outdoors in the Campo de’ Fiori. Pre-dinner drinks (aperitivi) accompanied with small hors d'oeuvres (antipasti) are enjoyed in the open air by Rome’s student set, surrounded by mouth-watering displays of fresh fruit and vegetables.
5. Care for your coffee: In Italy, a latte is simply a glass of milk. If you’d like coffee in your glass as well, order a caffe latte. A latte macchiato (meaning "marked") is steamed milk with a small shot of espresso. Espresso doppio means a double shot of espresso. Be warned, however, that no one in Rome drinks coffee past 11 am (by then they are onto their first glass of Chianti.)

	You will get to experience a lifestyle that might be different to what you are used to back home. You can choose to live in huge world famous city or more relaxed locations close to the beach. There are so many different opportunities available, for example you could experience the hustle and bustle of a large city by teaching English in Hong Kong, or for a more peaceful experience how about going to teach in Thailand and living somewhere exotic like Phuket!

	 

	5. Boost Your Career

	

	Getting practical hands on work experience

	 

	6. English Placements

	Worried about your language skills not being the best? Don&#39;t worry, although you can go and intern abroad placements are most of the time in English. Most placements do not require you to know any foreign languages as you will usually be placed with international companies who have English speaking staff. 

	 

	7. Make New Friends

	Thousands of people intern in destinations all around the world every year, you will get to know other staff and make new friends. The experience of living and working abroad will be so exciting and in your spare time you will get to hang out with your new friends

	 

	8. Improve Your Language Skills

	An internship overseas is a great way to learn a new language or pick up the basics. For example, you could learn Chinese in China, study Portuguese in Brazil, book a Spanish course in South America, learn German in Germany just to name a few options.

	 

	9. Go Sightseeing

	You will get lots of free time to see more of your new destination with nights and weekends off. This is a great chance to travel and see more of your new country! So you get two great experiences in one, a career boosting internship and the chance to travel!

	 

	10. Make Friends & Family Jealous

	This really is one of the most amazing experiences

Top 10 Reasons to Volunteer in Costa Rica

	In 2017 Abi Phillips travelled through Central America and into Costa Rica to volunteer for 2 months on the Caribbean coast near the Tortuguero national park. Abi had always been interested in volunteering, conservation and nature and so she joined a turtle conservation project called La Tortuga Feliz which turned out to be the best experience of her life. Here she shares her experience and top 10 reasons why volunteering in Costa Rica is awesome.


	Here she shares her experience and top 10 reasons why volunteering in Costa Rica is awesome.

	 

	1.Biodiverstiy

	Rich in biodiversity, a top game player in eco-tourism and ecological research facilities, Costa Rica is a prime location for any sort of volunteer experience. Any hostel I visited I was sure to meet someone who had either finished up an amazing volunteer programme or was working on some exciting monkey or plant study. Everyone is on the nature vibe, climbing volcanos, venturing ancient jungles and immersing themselves in the green belt.

	 

	2. Techno Debunk

	One of my favourite things about my experience volunteering with turtles in Costa Rica was the technology debunk! Sure, if you want you can bring with you a solar charger and spend a while soaking up the sun’s rays to send a few texts home (depending on power facilities). But when do you ever have the experience now days to spend time completely technologically isolated, with no phone attached to you. I felt cleansed, mindful and far more social without any technology and what we think to be modern necessities!

	 

	3.Turtles, Turtles, Turtles

	With 4 species of turtles visiting the beach during the night over several busy months of the year. You will see at least one turtle at the bare minimum and it will be awesome. Perhaps under a full moon, a sky of stars or a tropical thunderstorm you will see her crawl out of the sea and lay her eggs right in front of you. A truly dreamlike experience that little can compare. Learning how to care, protect and support these giant prehistoric creatures is an understanding that you will never forget.

	 

	4. People

	Meeting people was super exhilarating. Due to the nature of the place and the reasons why each person has chosen to come, you instantly have a connection with everyone there so it’s easy to go alone and have a little family the next day. I travelled here alone and left with close friends from all over the world of all ages and stages. Everyone shares such a passion and love for nature, conservation and the environment, its magical!

	 

	5. Biology

	Knowledge about conservation and Biology. These.people.know.their.stuff.  Not only is there an immense wealth of knowledge held by the local guides but everyone arranging the walks, hatchery, station and grounds is either a biologist or studying to be one or something similar. I learnt so much about not only conservation here in Costa Rica but all over the world. My knowledge of biology, ecosystems and ecology grew 10-fold and I left feeling like I had just been to the most thrilling school ever. 

	 

	6. Travel

	Right smack in the middle of Americas, Costa Rica is the perfect location to not only volunteer but use as a travel base before and after volunteering. Neighbouring countries such as Nicaragua to the north or Panama to the southern border are equally incredible travel destinations. Travelling through Costa Rica was like taking a deep breath of fresh air and relaxing a little bit as out of all of the Central American countries I would say this is the safest. It has an awesome, established hostel environment, great and easy bus system, an established international airport offering affordable flights, good roads and great professional tourism. Check out Costa Rica tours

	 

	7. Local Culture / Practise Spanish

	I would recommend practising some basic Spanish before coming to learn as much as you can from the local guides! Duolingo is perfect for this. Its super easy to pick up basic words and is a fun easy app to use. You can also book a Spanish course in Costa Rica. The Costa Rican people are warm, funny and friendly! The local guides who help with guiding for night walks rule that beach! They are turtle whisperers at heart and the ocean is in their soul. If you can get to know them, throw around a few jokes and listen to their honeypot of turtle knowledge you will come away with a beyond valuable experience. Food is fantastic, Costa Rican culture and crafts are colourful, beautiful and exciting. Pura Vida!

	 

	8. Baby Turtles

	And what comes with mama turtles is baby turtles. Releasing newly hatched turtles into a glowing pink and red sunset has to be one of life’s greatest experiences. So much life moving out into the sea, and you have helped to save each and every one of them. Waiting all hunched over a nest for the first sand to cave in as a rare species of hawksbill emerges for their first real breath is one of those unforgettable moments.  

	 

	9. Read, Relax, Recover

	Yup, you will be busy and you will be tired at times but you will also have some great down time, so bring an awesome book or just relax in a hammock and watch the lizards scuttle around. Get in touch with yourself and take in the sea breeze! Being here is a great time to unwind, connect to nature and be away from any life stresses or the business of being! Being in touch with nature so closely is a unique moment to make relaxing an easier process.

	 

	10. Natural Wonderland

	It’s hard to count how many animals I saw in Costa Rica. Lizards of all types were abundant, trails of ants to step over and monkeys moving about in the trees overhead. Thousands and thousands of unique species of plants, flowers in abundance for the butterflies and trees towering over like skyscrapers. If you are a super nature enthusiast I would recommend bringing a bird, bug or plant field guide as it’s fun to try identify your favourites.

	 

	I would go back to Costa Rica to volunteer in a heartbeat and to visit again all the baby turtles who come back to their place of nesting to lay their own eggs. When you help one species it creates a network of life that filters into more and more environments so get volunteering and who knows what your change will bring.

Top Ideas What to Do During a Gap Year Before Medical School

	Are you wondering how should you spend your medical gap year? Need ideas for how to spend time before going to medical school? For many a gap year isn’t planned. The fierce competitive nature of applying to medical school means that many are left with no other option but to take a year out and reapply the following year. After the initial disappointment of not getting into med school at the first attempt, embrace your gap year, it may just be the best thing you ever do. 


	The reality is that getting into med school isn’t easy. UK based medical schools are so over subscribed that there’s a good chance prospective medical students will have to take a gap year if unsuccessful and reapply the following year. Prospective medical school students are generally very focused in their desire to succeed in their chosen discipline. Medicine for many is a vocation, if an applicant finds themself unsuccessful in applying for medical school the first time many will take time to improve their applications for the next year. This also shows the medical schools that you will be applying to, that you have the dedication needed to succeed in your career and that you wont be deterred by failing to get a place at the first attempt.

	An applicant that can pick themselves up from a setback like not be accepted the first time and come back with a stronger application the second time around is demonstrating a resolve that can only be looked upon favourably. Many see an imposed gap year as a bad thing but a year out of education before embarking on a long and tough medical degree isn’t necessarily a bad thing. People looking back on their imposed gap year are thankful of it and in many cases if used correctly it can be of great benefit to your future medical career. For many also it is a time to take stock. A career in medicine should not be entered into frivolously and many medical gap year students will use the extra experience gained during their gap year to reaffirm their decision to enter into the world of medicine.

	 

	 

	5 Useful Ways to Spend a Medical Gap Year

	 

	Get some medical work experience

	Show the medical school admissions staff that you used your gap year wisely, get some valuable experience in your chosen field either in the UK or abroad to show a willingness to learn and a commitment to medicine.

	 

	Go traveling

	See the world, enjoy different cultures, you will come back a more mature person for exploring the world and can help you prepare for living away during university.

	 

	Polish that personal statement and your interview skills

	You have a year off so practise practise and practise some more for those all important medical school interviews and applications.

	 

	Work & Earn some money!

	Medical school certainly isn’t cheap and working for a year will certainly help you combat these costs and allow you to do more when at university!

	 

	Combine all four!

	Work for a few months, volunteer on weekends, save up, go traveling, turn it into a medical gap year and when you come back you’ll find the UCAS form isn’t big enough to list all you have done in your medical gap year!

	 

	However you choose to spend your medical gap year be sure to make it useful. The worst thing you can do on a gap year, especially if the reason for taking one is rejections from medical school, is to stagnate, not improving your chances of entry the following year. As med school places become even more at a premium you may just find yourself joining the ranks of the growing number of impromptu medical gap year students, relish the opportunity to fill your year with medical experience, your application will look too good to overlook next year and it might just be the best thing you ever do.

	Companies like Gap Medics, Work the World, Projects Abroad and Volunteering Solutons offers pre-university medical and nursing work experience placements to help you on your way to a career in healthcare.

This can be one of the most amazing experiences on your life but there are lots of things you might not know if you have never done anything like this before.

	Before Departing

	
		Research destinations before departing by viewing websites and buying guide books

		Try to put together a rough itinerary, know what to see, how to reach those places, where to stay, make budget plan
		 
	
		Check forums, websites and facebook pages for country information and latest travel news
		 
	
		Buy a guidebook to take with you to research destinations and places you would like to visit
		 
	
		Consider paying a little extra and join overland tours in Asia, this will be a lot more relaxed as you will be guided to all destinations


	 

	 

	When Abroad

	
		Research its good to know where&#39;s considered the "bad" part of town (even if its not really)
		 
	
		Connect with locals and other travellers as much as you can
		 
	
		Carry a first aid kit
		 
	
		Learn local basic phrases like hi, please, where, and thank you

	Meeting New People

	
		A lot of places have free wifi and internet especially in Thailand for example, but don&#39;t get stuck in front of your computer this might put people off mixing with you
		 
	
		Get talking everywhere you go, no traveler is ever alone just use your gut instinct on who is nice / not
		 
	
		You meet the most people at hostels / dorms so don&#39;t be afraid to make friends anywhere and everywhere. Some people might not turn out to be best friends with you but it might help during that part of a trip
		 
	
		Be open and curious - you&#39;ll meet more people, have more immersive experiences & do things that others haven&#39;t
		 
	
		Stay in shared / dorm accommodation


	 

	 

	Safety Advice

	
		Check a countries safety advice on a official website source, some countries like Cambodia and China might sound scary but in reality they are very safe to visit
		 
	
		Be your own best counsel - if it doesn&#39;t feel right, don&#39;t do it
		 
	
		Have the courage to talk to others and try to make friends to travel with
		 
	
		Know and respect culture around, and follow ur instinct, if something feels too good to be true it probably is
		 
	
		If you ever feel uneasy / bad about a situation try to get away
		 
	
		Ask fellow travellers for their experiences and destination advice
		 
	
		Remember not everyone wants to harm you, but not everyone wants to be your best friend
		 
	
		Look confident and try not to dont dress like a tourist, try to pass for a local if possible (reading a local paper might be going a little to far though)
		 
	
		Create a site plan for the city and have a good map prior to starting out. Stay at a hostel / hotel in a city center

		Can you Apply?
	
		To apply to work at a summer camp in the USA you must fulfill the following criteria:
	
		
			Aged 18 by 1 June of the year you want to go
		
			Available to fly between 1 May and 20 June
		
			Be available for a minimum nine week period during summer
		
			Fluent in English
		
			Applicants should have some experience working or volunteering with children and/or have experience in a particular sport or activity
		
			A basic first aid certificate might also be required before you start work at some camps
		
			If you are not a UK citizen you will need to check your own visa requirements and ensure you can obtain a visa before applying 
	
	
		If you start your application soon you&#39;ll have lots of time to give yourself the best chance of getting accepted, there will be lots of time to put together your application and put all your skills and relevant experience on the application. When applying it is important that you have some previous experience of working or interacting with children in a supervisory role. The level of experience needed for camp varies and could be anything, from helping out at a club, to teaching your own sports lessons, all depending on the individual needs of the camps. You may be able to gain more experience and thereby improve your chances, simply by asking in your local community, at schools and weekend clubs if they need any help. Local organisations are often very happy for volunteers to get involved and be a part of their team. You can also improve your chances of placement by working to get a qualification in a sport or other activity at which you are already proficient. If you are unsure of whether your skills or experience meet the requirements, please get in contact with us for further information or clarification. 
	
		 
	
		
			What Company to Apply With
	
	
		To work at a summer camp in the USA you will need to apply through an international sending agency who can arrange your visa and placement. If you are totally new to the experience of applying to working at camps you might be suprised to know there are more companies than just &#39;Camp America&#39; which are the most well known company. Summer camp hiring companies all offer packages to internationals which will help you to get the most amazing summer of your life. 
	
		Generally these companies offer information and guidance every step of the process, placements, return flights to the USA and travel to camp, a J1 visa (this is essential), all neccesary paperwork, comprehensive medical insurance, a salary, meals and accommodation whilst at camp and also support throughout the summer in case of any problems or emergencies. You will need to pay a fee for this service which is usually around £400 - £600 depending on the company, this is usually in installments in the run up to summer. Each sending agency offers differing services and costs you will need to check this before applying. If you are thinking about working at a summer camp in USA / Canada we recommend applying with one of the following companies: 
	
		
			Camp America - Established in 1969 the longest running sending agency in the business
		
			BUNAC - Over 120,000 people have been placed on Camp USA in the past 50 years
		
			Camp Leaders - One of the market leaders in the industry placing thousands of participants every summer
		
			InterExchange - Connect international candidates to host camps throughout the USA
		
			International Exchange Programs (IEP) - A non-profit organisation specialising in sending young New Zealanders on working holidays overseas,  IEP&#39;s Summer Camp USA programme is open to New Zealand Citizens. 
		
			
				Other companies you might want to think about applying with include AmeriCamp, CCUSA, WildPacks, 3 Adventures and USA Summer Camp.
		
	
	
		 
	
		Types of Jobs Available to International Staff
	
		Counselor Jobs - Working in the position of a camp counsellor you have to be an excellent role model who puts the needs of the campers first. You will be responsible for a group of children leading them through daily acitivites and sleeping in a cabin with them.
	
		Specialist Counselor - You will be asked to instruct a skilled activity for example archery. Your main role will be to run or assist in running your activity during the day.
	
		Office Staff - Help out in the camp office, roles can involve receptionist duties, answering the phone, dealing with questions and queries whilst organising events.
	
		Kitchen Staff Jobs - Kitchen staff roles includes cooks, an assistant cooks, food preparation staff, dish washers and food deliverance.
	
		Maintenance Positions - Work behind the scenes, repairing cabins, taking part in general maintenance which help to keep camps running smoothly during summer
	
		You can read more information about these positions on our main summer camp jobs page.
	
		 
	
		 
	
		Interviews & Orientation
	
		When appyling to work at a camp you will need to attend an interview to assess suitability. We have put together some useful advice on how to prepare for your summer camp interview and how to pass. Before you start remember the person who will be interviewing you wants you to pass and sign up to apply for camp. There is not need to be scared or nervous, try to be relaxed and honest. The interview will include a range of questions seeing if you are right for the job and trying to match you to the right camp. Example questions can include:
	
		&#39;Give me an example of when you have worked with young people&#39;
		&#39;What are your stenghts&#39;
		‘Tell me about a time you went out of your way to help someone’
		‘Tell me about a time you worked with children and what experience do you have’
		&#39;Why do you want to work at a camp&#39;  
	
		During the interview the interviewer will be taking notes, please do not worry about this this is to report back to the head office. We recommend dressing smart / casual, jeans are fine and wearing a suit and tie is a bit too formal. Clothing shouldn&#39;t be a major factor if you pass the interview though. Remember to have fun and enjoy the interview at the same time, this is also your chance to ask questions and get an insight into camp life as your interviewer will have been to camp before. After the interview it can take a while to find out if you passed, if you do you can start preparing for summer.
	
		 
	
		What Happens Next
	
		If you have had an interview and been accepted you will then be able to log onto your online account to track your application. You might need to fill in some more supporting documents and then you will be matched to a camp. You have the option to wait to see if you get placed, or you can attend camp fairs or apply online direct to camps. Our website featured thousands of camps but you will need to check they are working with your sending agency (e.g. Camp America, Camp Leaders etc). We highly recommend going to the recruitment fairs and finding camps to avoid the dissapointment of not being placed and therefore not going to the USA. Jobs are competative so it&#39;s important you apply early and put together a strong application, just being accepting onto the summer camp programme doesn&#39;t 100% guarantee you will get a position. View our summer camp job board for positions if you want to search out a camp for yourself.
	
		 
	
		Once you have been Placed
	
		Once you have a confirmed place you will be booked onto a flight and be provided with more information about the summer ahead. To ensure that you are as fully prepared as possible for a summer on camp, you need to attend an orientation before you leave for the US. Orientations take place in various cities around the UK. You will receive further details once you have applied to the summer camp programme. Your outbound flight date will depend on the start date on your contract and the where your camp is located. Most flights generally depart from London and arrive into New York but sometimes flights can be into LA or more remote areas of the States and Canada.
	
		 
	
		What to Pack
	
		
			The debate around taking a suitcase or backpack really comes down to personal preference, both are good options
		
			Light clothing, you will usually be given a staff uniform or will be able to buy camp clothing on arrival so try not to take too many clothes with you
		
			Flip flops and a good pair of trainers
		
			Some selected smart clothes for when you leave camp grounds
		
			We highly recommend taking some pictures of where you live, your friends and family - campers will be very interested to learn about you 
		
			Passport, money, traveller cheques, credit card 
		
			A copy of all important documents e.g. passport, insurance, tickets and travel details
		
			Remember at camp you might be working and living in rustic conditons so please think twice before taking expensive items like ipads or macbooks 
		
			Do not worry if you forget anything, in the USA there are huge supermarkets which offer cheap goods like clothes and accessories
	
	
		 
	
		
			Arrival in the USA
		
			So you have applied to work at camp and wondering what happens when you arrive, get ready for the greatest summer of your life! Before departing you will be given a return ticket and all the information you need about getting to your camp. Some companies offer an orientation in New York but some allow you to independently to make your way to camp, usually you are placed on group flights and you&#39;ll meet other people working at your camp. When you arrive at camp you will have an orientation. This can last from one day to one week, depending on your camp. This orientation could include; preparing the camp for the kids or getting to know your role and how the camp operates. You may not know all of your duties until after the orientation when your camp director has assessed all the staff and assigned the various jobs. 
		
			Programme Support
		
			Throughout your stay in the USA or Canada you will have the support and guidance of onsite staff. They will provide you with competent assistance and help you with any questions or advice you may need during your stay. In addition, you will receive an emergency contact for onsite staff when you arrive and we will provide you with a 24 hour emergency contact number before you depart, so that you can contact staff in your home country at any time should you need to.
	
	
		Accommodation and Meals
	
		Your first night in your destination e.g. New York is usually included (hostel dorm room) in the package price you pay. Any nights between then and arriving at the camp are not included in the programme fee. During the camp you will live and have meals with the campers. Your accommodation can very depending on the camp and meals will be eaten in the dining area. 
	
		Free Time 
	
		You will have an afternoon and one day off each week (though different camps may vary). During this day off you can stay on-site to relax, read etc or you can opt to do some independent travel. It may be a good idea to take books and games for leisure time when you can socialise with the other counsellors.
	
		 
	
		Camp FAQ
	
		We have put together a list of frequently asked questions about working at a camp in the USA which will hopefully help you get as much information as possible...
	
		
			What time will I have to wake up at summer camp? - Usually between 7 and 8 on most days, but you will get some days and weekends off. 
		
			What are American children really like? - Usually very fun to be around, being surround by kids and working with them daily can be challenging but American children are really no different to any others. In your time at camp you will probably meet all types of children from the annoying problem children to the ones you will really miss. 
		
			Can I drink / smoke at camp? - Camps usually have a strick no drinking / smoking policy and being caught breaking these rules can result in you being fired or more seriously arrested. Please think before engaging in such activities especially if you are under 21 years of age. 
		
			What if I don’t like working at summer camp? - This is a very rare case, most people really enjoy the American summer camp experience but if you are not one of them don&#39;t dispair. You can try to make the most of the situation and try to enjoy it or after discussing your situation with your agency you can leave and return home.
		
			What is the food like at camp? - Eating healthy might be difficult but most camps have a variety of food and healthy options like salad bars should be available. Sweets and chocolate can be quite sugary, same with drinks. 
		
			How do I cope with homesick campers? - Please seek advice from more experience staff and try to take the campers minds away from home. 
		
			Will I get paid in cash at camp? - This varies depending on your camp but don&#39;t worry you will get paid. 
		
			Can I accept tips from parents? - Sometimes when parents either drop their children off or pick them up they give you tips (which is very common in the USA). You will need to find your camp&#39;s policy regarding tips and if you can accept them. 
		
			Camp is on for a long time, will I get bored? - usually when the campers arrive summer flys by Working at a summer camp can give you a range of emotions and can be an amazing experience, most people who have participated describe it as the best summer of their life. 
		
			What do I do in my spare time? - Camp can be exhausting so spare time is usually spent relaxing, take a good book or an ipod to escape the hustle and bustle of camp life. 
		
			What do I do on days / nights off from camp? - Usually you have time off with other counsellors so you can go off camp and explore tourist sights. On nights off you might want to visit the local town and grab a pizza. As long as you are back before the camp curfew and can wake up the next morning you shouldn&#39;t have any problems. Also local American staff are usually very friendly and will go out of their way to shown you their hometowns and surrounding areas.

	What Past Internationals have to say

	"The best decision you&#39;ll ever make. Camp was totally different to what I could ever imagine, it&#39;s the best summer you&#39;ll ever have! Explore the real America and make life long friendships with people all over the world. Amazing is an uderstatement." - Matty, UK

	"The summer went like lightning, every day was better than the last and the progress the kids made was amazing.You make friends for life at camp!." - Richard, UK

	"This will be my 4th summer...If you are thinking about doing it, go for it, its so much different to anything else in the world, waterskiing all summer and then travelling afterwards isn&#39;t a bad way to spend the summer!" - Chris, Australia

	"I applied with Camp America and I&#39;ve had a really good experience. I applied really late but I had my interview straight away, and they found me a camp a few weeks later. I was actually really surprised how quickly they found a camp for me as I have limited experience with children and I can&#39;t start camp until June 21st due to exams - a lot of camp start weeks before this."  - Cheryl, England

	"When I arrived at camp, I had one week before i could leave camp to buy things, so take the essentials. leave some room in your case, so you can buy loads of clothes and bring them back. Try and fit two weeks worth of clothes in your case ( you can buy some when your there) as you go through that in about 1 week, and usually there isnt a washing machine on camp, we could only wash our clothes on a weekend at the local town 3 miles away." 
	Vicky, England

	"Approach the kids like an older cousin, allow them to be your friends, but let them know that you are in charge. ALWAYS listen to them. Give each one equal attention, but let them have personal space when they want. Crying is acceptable, but try not to reason with an overly emotional kid (I find telling them that I can&#39;t help their cause whilst they are crying and not listening to me)" 
	Sally, Norway

Varna Travel Guide

	Bulgaria is grossly overlooked, and nowhere within Bulgaria is more overlooked than Varna. This coastal city is within close range of Sophia (Bulgaria’s Capital) and of Sunny Beach, Bulgaria’s tourism hotspot. View our travel g


	 

	Getting there:

	I travelled to Varna on a last-minute Thomas Cook booking which because I was flying solo, was very cheap. There are always cancellations or free seats on planes so you should always try and be spontaneous when booking your flights, my flight from Manchester (England) to Varna (Bulgaria) was £58 pounds, without a return of course.

	 

	Currency

	Once you are in Bulgaria you’ll instantly start to question the cost of things. I exchanged my money in England and got 100 Bulgarian Lev for roughly 48 pounds meaning 2 Lev is near enough equal to 1 pound. Bulgaria is scarily cheap in a lot of ways, you can buy a 2-litre bottle of Beer here for 2 lev, eating out costs about the same if you stay outside of the inner city and even then the prices for a meal don’t get anywhere near 10 lev, which is a fiver. If you played it smart you could live in Varna for a long time on a very small budget. I have been getting around the city using mainly busses, which no matter where you’re getting off, are One Lev. I have been staying in a small apartment complex in the less commercial part of the city and so getting the bus is a must to reach any of the amazing places in Varna. 

	 

	The Malls (There are three, but the Grand Mall is the best, for now)

	In the centre of Varna is the Grand Mall, which has everything that you could want, including an IMAX cinema which by the way only plays their films in English, unless it’s an animation. Beware of the fact that other languages won’t be translated for you, for example I went to see Skyscraper in IMAX and because its set in Hong Kong there were obviously Chinese speaking characters, they only provide the subtitles for such scenes in Bulgarian. So, don’t go and watch something like Loving Pablo, or Sicario: Soldado because they are likely to have Colombian or Spanish speaking characters and you’ll be at a loss, unless of course you speak those languages. The mall also has an arcade, millions of clothing outlets and a few games shops. There book shop has an English section with most of the popular books there so if you’ve run out of reading material its worth having a look there.

	 

	Sea side and night times

	The sea in Varna is beautiful, I recently went to Antalya in Turkey to find the beach was mostly rocks or boulders if you would. Varna is clear sands and clear seas though be careful when getting in. A quick story, I’m not really scared of anything in life okay, but somethings, I just can’t be doing with that. So, I went into the sea for a swin, and noticed a lot of sea weed, some old ladies were walking around with it on their faces and shoulders for its apparent healing properties but I just thought they looked like Scooby-Doo villains. So, I’m swimming and the seaweed begins to feel, weird. It was Jellyfish, hundreds upon hundreds of tiny or sometimes not so tiny, jellyfish. I hate Jellyfish. They are not harmful or anything but it took me a long time to get back in the water, they did eventually leave though.

	Next to the sea is the Sea Garden, a lovely rural area filled with constant activities, when I walked around there was a small group of people giving lessons on traditional Bulgarian dances. The next time there was a group of people teaching breakdancing. However, it is at night time when Varna really comes to life. All down the main streets and the sea garden are jugglers, musicians, magicians and dancers. Bright colours and good ice cream. Night time is when Varna really thrives and if you’re with friends or on your own you really feel part of the community.

	 

	Other:

	Other activities include Shooting ranges which are around 7 Lev for ten shots and swimming pools, he public ones are nice and are very cheap. Better take your sandals though. In my time here, I also visited NesseBar which is quite a large tourist attraction for its 12th and 13th century buildings, it’s a beautiful sea side town with some amazing views and places to eat.

Volunteer in Borneo


	
		
	
		Volunteer in Borneo
	
		Apply to become a volunteer on the spectacular island of Borneo and get ready for the most amazing experience of your life! Borneo is an exotic location to volunteer, this is the third largest island in the world home to some of the most stunning and endangered wildlife on the planet. Borneo is famous for its wildlife including orang-utans, sea turtles and bears - all of which are facing a difficult future. Due to humans the natural habitat of orang-utans is dissapearing at an alarming rate but as a volunteer you will be able to help these creatures, and other animals, as well as playing a key role in help with education and awareness. Most programs are run in the Malaysian state of Sabah and Sepilok. Applying to volunteer in Borneo will be one of the most amazing things you can do in your life, there are various conservation projects with animals and also community development initiatives available to join all year round. View our guide to volunteering in Borneo and apply for a life changing experience today.
	
		 
	
		 
	
		Top Reasons to Volunteer in Borneo
	
		
			Not many places in the world compare to this island - pictures do not do it justice
		
			There are so many animal species which are unique to this region
		
			The beaches and nature is incredible - this island will leave you in awe
		
			You will get to meet new people from all around the world - this is one of the most popular volunteer destinations in Asia
		
			By applying you will immerse yourself in the local culture and communities mixing with local people and learning about their traditions
	
	
		 
	
		 
	
		
	
		Wildlife Volunteer Projects in Borneo
	
		Most volunteering opportunities have a focus on wildlife and conservation, there are some of the most worthwhile projects in the world currently being operated here with various wildlife sanctuaries and outreach initiatives doing some inspiring work with orang-utans and other animals. At the moment wildlife natural habitats are being destroyed at an alarming rate partly due to palm oil plantations which means animals in this region face an uncertain future. A lot of animals are also killed by poachers and this results in many orphaned babies which need to be cared for by humans. There are projects where you can help sun bears, these are the smallest bear species which are only found in Asia. In Sepilok there is the Bornean Sun Bear Conservation centre which help sun bears with the ultimate aim of releasing them back into the wild. You could also be helping proboscis and other species of monkeys and pigmy elephants. Duties can include working in teams with local staff, collecting food, cleaning enclosures and helping with with general rehabilitation. You will also be able to help educate the local population about the need for conservation and there are also skilled placements available if you are seeking vetinary work experience.
	
		 
	
		 
	
		
	
		Volunteer with Orang-utans in Borneo
	
		Due to de-forestation orang-utans are facing an uncertain future in the wild but lots of inspiration work is being done in places like the world famous Sepilok Orang-utan Rehabilitation Centre to protect the wildlife and give them medical attention if they are injured. There are daily tours and educational talks where you can learn more about the animals and efforts being made to protect them. Working with orang-utans in Borneo is one of the most popular programs we offer on our website. Orangutans in Borneo are unfortunately very endangered and participating on these programs will be an unforgettable experience. Helping at an orangutan sanctuary is amazing, you will be able to see first hand the work being done to help and protect orang-utans which have been injured and rescued. Most programs have a focus on preservation and rehabilitation, these are wild animals (not pets) and you might be restricted to participating and helping from a distance. This is because places like the Sepilok Centre in Borneo want the orang-utans to live in a &#39;normal&#39; environment as possible whilst restricting hands on contact also reduces the chances of humans passing on illness/disease. Also on a lot of projects you won&#39;t get hands on contact, usually full time local staff will be the only people who get to feed the orang-utans.
	
		 
	
		 
	
		
	
		Volunteer with Sea Turtles in Borneo
	
		There are several sea turtle projects available to join in Borneo - you will get to live close to the ocean in a spectacular setting. Selingan Island is a remote and spectacular destination where turtles lay their eggs on the beaches. Lots of work is being done here to help protect the turtle eggs from poachers, you can visit and stay on the island or volunteer to help conservation efforts too. There are real problems with turtle poaching in South-East Asia and eggs are still openly sold in markets. More work needs to be done on educating the local population and getting them involved in conservation programs and you can play a role in helping.This island is one of the true paradises of the world, the ocean is crystal clear whilst the beaches very clean compared to others in South-East Asia.
	
		 
	
		 
	
		
	
		Environmental and Conservation Projects
	
		Borneo is a really beautiful island - probably like nowhere you will ever visit in your life. There are lots of local and international charities and organisations operating conservation projects in Borneo. The rainforests here are the oldest in the world at 130 million years old and home to so many exotic plants and animals which need protecting. Some projects are marine based and work to help giant clams and coral reefs, you will work alongside local staff monitoring the ocean, helping biodiversity and informing local communities and school children about the environment which needs to be protected.
	
		 
	
		 
	
		Community Development
	
		There are some really rewarding community and volunteer teaching programs available to join. Even though Borneo is a luxury destination it might shock you to realise there is very real poverty within local communities. Borneo is also home to 30 different ethnic groups, including the Kelabits, Penan, Dayaks, Dunsun, Murut and Kadayan and international charities and local NGO&#39;s have lots of initiatives operating to help improve the living conditions for rural communities and they accept international volunteers to help. There are also projects where you can help indigenous communities with the aim of preserving their traditions and cultures.
	
		 
	
		 
	
		
	
		Teach in Borneo
	
		It is estimated that around 20% of children in Sabah have never been to school and have never had a formal education. If you apply to teach in Borneo you will get to work helping school children improve their English writing and speaking skills. These placements are a lot of fun and you will usually get to help with coaching sports and other activities too. Local teachers will be very helpful for the duration of your stay and you will learn a lot of new skills, if you are looking for a rewarding way to volunteer and help people - we can&#39;t recommend these placements highly enough.
	
		 
	
		 
	
		
	
		How to Apply
	
		There are summer and year round placements available which can be booked in advance through our website. If you have certain dates in mind you will need to enquire well ahead to secure a spot. You can search our featured projects and register your interest, ask a question or apply today. Most organisations offer structured volunteering placements in Borneo where you will need to pay a fee to join.
	
		This usually includes:
	
		
			Placements and pre-departure information
		
			Training
		
			Airport transfers
		
			Shared accommodation
		
			3 meals daily
		
			In-country support
	
	
		 
	
		 
	
		
			How to Volunteer in Borneo for Free
		
			To volunteer for free in Borneo you will need to apply with a local NGO, sometimes you will still need to cover your accommodation and food though. Volunteering in Borneo for free or no cost can be difficult - this is an off the beaten track destination and most of the projects here need funding from donations and volunteers. Finding free volunteer projects with orangutans is nearly immpossible due to the complications with arranging placements and the need for donations to help with conservation efforts. If you are skilled proffessional e.g. doctor, architect, vet then you might be able to apply to join a paid / free placement as skilled workers are desperately needed to help people and improve facilities.

International volunteers can apply all year round.


	

	Guide to Volunteering Abroad with Children

	On childcare projects you can support and help abandoned children, street children, and HIV + children. There is always have a high demand for volunteers who are able to contribute some time and effort toward our child-care placement projects. On One World 365 you can find a variety of organizations that support children who are considered vulnerable within the local context of development. 

	Volunteers will be placed with organizations that promote education, vocational training, cultural activities, and general care. There is also a focus on teaching life-skills and trades so that all children can be self-sufficient, and able to attain their basic human rights with dignity. You may be placed with a youth center, school, community centre and there are also orphanage volunteer programs available.  

	Your role will depend on your background and the needs of the organization you are placed with at the time you go abroad. Activities may include caring for orphaned and abandonded children, arranging extra-curricular activities, focusing on education projects for street children, teaching trades, and playing games. 

	 

	 

	

	Popular Places to Apply

	You can find most placements in Africa, Asia and Latin America. There are thousands of children aged between 0 and 13 who have been abandoned, orphaned due to HIV / AIDS or have been living on the streets. Volunteers are needed in countries like Benin, Cameroon and Ghana to help provide children a brighter future, you can work in outreach teams and in schools, orphanages and community centres. 

	In Latin America volunteers are usually placed at non profit charitable institutions which provide a community service where all funds go to benefit abandoned children in countries like Brazil and Bolivia. Some organisations are operated under the protection of the Catholic Church Administration. Vocational work is done in an open way to provide a fair, equal and prosperous society.

	The objective of some village programs is to provide a community service for the problems of abandoned children. Most organisations have no political affiliations or profit making aims. Children&#39;s villages consist of individual family units, each housing a mixed gender group of 10-12 children of various ages. Each house is headed by a foster mother who manages the household independently. All live in harmony like a traditional family with mother and siblings. Siblings of blood are kept together. The children grow up in the children&#39;s villages and are being raised at home and in school on strong moral and religious principles.

	Once they have reached age 15-16 and completed middle school, they live in separate boys&#39; and girls&#39; residences. Most of them will go on to study a technical or professional career, and a few will even continue higher education at the University. Each child makes their own career decision based on his or her individual talents and intellect. The children remain in the residences until they are able to lead an independent life outside. Once their mission is accomplished, they integrate our youth into the society from which they came as respectable and educated persons. The project placements are located in cities throughout the continent and usually most volunteer placements are located within 15 - 30 minutes away from accommodation. Volunteers use local transportation such as mini bus or taxis for their commuting.

	In Asia education is extremely underfunded and lots of children and young people are not given the care they need at the start of their lives. In countries like Thailand and Cambodia there is a shocking rate of homeless street children living in real poverty but local volunteer organizations try to help by removing the children from the streets and take them to safer places. Childcare volunteer programs give you the chance to get involved and make a real difference to the lives of children and give service. Usually you will need to stay for a minimum of 4 weeks and sometimes you might need to be aged 21+ and have relevant experience.

	 

	 

	

	Tasks

	Tasks can include caring, counseling, cooking, cleaning, planning and leading fun activities and help children with homework. Sometimes you might work with children affected by illness or disability. These placements can be very emotional and so you might want to research before joining, it will be the most rewarding experience on your life.

WAVA launches 'School Gap Year Volunteering Groups' programme
WAVA recently launched a new gap year group volunteering programme for 16 to 17 year old school students who want to travel and volunteer... Maybe WAVA have taken leave of our senses, but after a considerable amount of thought (and planning), they have decided to offer younger travellers who are not quite 18 years old, the chance to take part in some of the gap year volunteering programmes.
WAVA have chosen Mozambique, South Africa and Thailand as the first destinations to be included in the new gap year programme for students eager to find out more about the developing world and its conservation issues.

WAVA's School Volunteer Groups programme offers structured outdoor projects that provide hands-on animal and environmental work for students aged 16 to 17.

These students get to travel to meaningful projects in inspiring countries around the world, and experience new cultures and conservation practices that have been designed to contribute to their personal development.

Hordes of young people have approached us in the past wanting to travel and help other countries. WAVA feel that it is only fair that we give them the opportunity to do so. After all, the young people of today will 'hopefully' be the champion volunteers of tomorrow.

Work in Australia

	View our work and travel programs in Australia. On our guide to working in Australia where you can read information, get advice and apply for your dream job. With One World 365 you can apply for a working holiday in places like Sydney, Perth, Melbourne, Brisbane and the Outback. Australia is perfect for a working holiday; if you’re planning to take time out and would like to experience living abroad, expect friendly people, a warm climate, an outdoors and laid back lifestyle.


	Working Holidays in Australia

	There are lots of jobs in Australia in lots of different professions and wages are generally higher than other countries worldwide. If you would like to know if you are eligible for an Australia work visa please read more information below and also learn how you can apply. 

	A working holiday can be a good way to fund ongoing travel and is a great way to make new friends. It can also be a useful addition to your CV; while most companies don’t look down on a gap year or period of travel, if you can demonstrate that you have worked while travelling this will certainly be in your favor when you return home and are trying to get a job. In order to work while in Australia you will need a specific type of Australia visa. The most likely visa option that you will go with is a working holiday visa. This type of visa is available to those aged between 18 and 30 and allows the holder to live and work in Australia for a period of up to 12 months, though it’s important to understand that the working holiday visa was not intended as a route to permanent migration in Australia, but instead designed for people who want to supplement the cost of their holiday through work.

	A working holiday visa enables you to enter Australia within 12 months of the visa’s start date, and stay in the country for up a year. While the visa is valid, you are allowed to enter and exit Australia as many times are you like. Another important rule to remember is that while you are allowed to stay in Australia for up to a year, you can only work with an employer for up to six months, after which you have to change jobs. That said, you can apply for a second working holiday visa, which will allow you to reside in Australia for a further 12 months but you will only be able to work in Australia for a further six months. To be eligible for this type of visa you may be asked to undergo certain health checks. Also in regards to your health it is recommended, when travelling to Australia, to purchase travel insurance as this visa will not entitle you to Australia’s national health care; this means that if you do need treatment it can be very expensive. Another prerequisite of being accepted for this visa is that you can demonstrate that you have enough money to support yourself, at least for the initial part of your holiday. When entering Australia you must also be able to prove that you have a return or onward ticket or the necessary funds to leave the country.

	Interestingly, a recent addition to the visa process is the Australian Values Statement. This is something that you will have to sign and essentially means that you are declaring that you will respect the Australian way of life and obey the laws of the land. To apply for a working holiday visa, you must be outside Australia; you can’t lodge an application while already travelling in the country. This means that when you are planning your trip it is very important not to book any flights or accommodation until your working holiday visa has been accepted. As mentioned above, it is possible to get a second working holiday visa if you want to stay in one job for longer than six months. In this your application can be made when you are either in or outside of Australia. The only important thing to note is that if you make your application for a second visa while outside Australia you have to be outside when it is accepted. Similarly, should you lodge your visa application while in Australia you must be in the country when it is granted. When applying for a second working holiday visa, remember that you must complete your application well in advance of your first visa’s expiry date, as if your first visa ends before your second is granted you may be liable for deportation.

	It is also worth remembering that each working holiday visa is linked to a specific passport. Therefore, if you change your passport for any reason after you have been granted a visa but before you visit Australia, you will need to contact the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. Otherwise, you will probably be subject to severe delays at the airport and may even be refused permission to board your plane. As a guide, an application for a first working holiday visa will take around six days, while one for a second working visa will take around 21. Working holiday visas also cover study for up to four months. If you would like to study at the same institution for longer than this period then it is possible to do this by applying for a second working holiday visa, as discussed above. Following these steps and securing a working holiday visa before travelling will mean that you are able to fully enjoy your time in this country. If you apply with a sending agency / travel company they will be able to provide job hunting assistance or you can just apply independently and seeking employment in advance or on arrival. There are lots of jobs in different professions in Australia, popular jobs people apply for include working in the hospitality industry behind a bar, cleaning, as a receptionist. In cities you could work in hotels, hostels or in office environments. By working on a farm or on a vineyard you could find yourself picking fruit or helping at a ranch with cattle.

Zimbabwe Black Rhino Conservation Volunteer Programs

	Travel to Zimbabwe and volunteer with black rhinos on animal conservation projects with One World 365. Volunteers are needed at wildlife orphanages, rescue centres and to help directly with rescueing rhinos frmom the wild. Black Rhinoceroses are facing a bleak future with extinction looming, you can play a part in trying to help these beautiful creatures in Zimbabwe. Read on for more information about volunteering with rhinos in Zimbabwe...


	Rhinos used to have large numbers in Zimbabwe, but in the 1980&#39;s and 1990&#39;s poaching was rife and war occured which meant than rhinos become extinct in the Zambezi Valley where they were once in their thousands. After rhinos became extinct in the Zambezi Valley the remaining rhinos in Zimbabwe were moved into conservation areas where they would be safer, and hopefully away from issues like poaching.

	You could volunteer at a safari ranch, wildlife orphanage or rescue centre in Zimbabwe, these placements are perfect if you have a passion for wildlife conservation, or you would like to gain hands on vetinary work experience, or if you would just generally like to help out. You will be resposible for looking after the rhinos and full training will be provided. Poaching is still a problem in Zimbabwe, the money made from rhinos horns can be large compared to normal wages and you will be able to help by trying to catch poachers and by educating local populations about the need to save the rhino.

	 

	Travel and volunteer in Zimbabwe with One World 365, search our full list of projects with rhinos or view all of our holidays and trips.
